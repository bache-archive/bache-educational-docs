    <p><em>Chris Bache builds on Stanislav Grof’s discovery of COEX systems—clusters of condensed experience—to explain how both personal and collective trauma are stored, activated, and healed within the deeper structures of consciousness.</em></p>
<p><em>This page references </em><em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe (LSDMU)</em><em> and synthesizes themes from the book and public talks.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“A COEX system, short for <em>system of condensed experience,</em> is a constellation of memories from many periods of an individual’s life that share a common emotional charge.”<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.2 §4 ¶4</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stanislav Grof, the Czech psychiatrist who founded <em>transpersonal psychology</em>, mapped the architecture of the psyche revealed in thousands of LSD sessions. He found that experiences are not stored separately but cluster around emotional themes—anger, fear, love, abandonment—forming multi-layered “systems of condensed experience,” or <strong>COEX systems</strong>. Healing, in this view, means dissolving these clusters from the surface layers down to their emotional core.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The collective psyche appears to organize its memories in ways that parallel how the personal unconscious organizes its memories.”<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.4 §2 ¶6</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bache extends Grof’s insight from the individual to the collective. Just as a person carries condensed memories of their own life, humanity carries <em>meta-COEX systems</em>—vast, emotionally charged fields containing the unresolved anguish of our species. These are the psychic imprints of war, oppression, and suffering that burden the human story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“An individual seems to be able to tap into and directly facilitate a healing of some portion of the collective psyche.”<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.6 §1 ¶5</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through his high-dose LSD practice, Bache found himself drawn into these collective strata, re-living epochs of human pain as if assisting in their release. What began as a philosophical exploration became, in Grof’s terms, a therapeutic process enacted on a planetary scale—a single mind resonating with the larger Mind of the species.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For about the first two years, I worked at what Stan Grof describes as the perinatal level of consciousness…until my personal reality was shattered. I died as the person I had known myself to be and was then reborn into a reality that radically transcended Chris Bache’s reality.”<br />

</blockquote>
<p>In this deeper terrain, Bache’s understanding of COEX evolved into a cosmological vision: layers of personal, perinatal, collective, and archetypal consciousness nested within one another, each capable of transformation through compassionate engagement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What Stan found is that the psyche organizes its experiences—its memories—into clusters, thematically integrated clusters.… When we encounter a problem in the psyche, we encounter a cluster that may reach back to birth or even former lives.”<br />

<p><strong>LSDMU ch.2 §4 ¶4</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A COEX system, short for “system of condensed experience,” is a specific constellation of memories (and fantasies) from many periods of an individual’s life that share a common theme and are marked by a common emotional charge. … At the center of each system is a core experience or set of experiences that represents the primary disturbance, the seed experience around which later experiences cluster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.4 §2 ¶6</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The collective psyche appears to organize its memories in ways that parallel how the personal unconscious organizes its memories. … It appears to gather the memories of humanity into <em>giant memory clusters</em> that come from different people and different historical periods but share a common emotional theme. I call these collective memory clusters META-COEX systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.6 §1 ¶5</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as painful experiences can accumulate and block the healthy functioning of the individual, similar blockages can occur at the collective level. … In this setting, an individual seems able to tap into and directly facilitate a healing of some portion of the collective psyche. The process of engaging and healing a collective META-COEX system is essentially the same as engaging a personal COEX system, but enacted on a much larger scale and a different level of consciousness.</p>

<p>“I read Stan Grof’s <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em> and my life pivoted. He was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness where the answers to the philosophical questions I was carrying lay.”<br />

<p>“Our species gathers its trauma in vast collective COEX systems—what I call meta-matrices.… It took a long time to accept, because it sounded arrogant—as if my sessions were impacting humanity’s psyche—but it was simply the natural deepening of the Death-Rebirth cycle.”<br />

<h2 id="notes-synthesis">Notes &amp; synthesis</h2>
<p>For readers new to Grof: COEX systems are the backbone of his transpersonal psychology—maps of how emotion binds memory. Bache inherits this model but expands it beyond the individual psyche. In his LSD sessions, personal COEX layers opened into collective and archetypal strata, convincing him that trauma and healing operate through nested fields of consciousness. Grof provided the clinical map; Bache extended it into a cosmological vision of species-level evolution.</p>
