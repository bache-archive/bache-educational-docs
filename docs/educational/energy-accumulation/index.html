    <p><em>Bache argues that psychedelic practice doesn’t just produce isolated peaks—it </em><em>stores</em><em> energetic momentum across sessions, requiring acclimation, hygiene, and pacing to stabilize deeper states.</em></p>
<p><em>This page references </em><em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe (LSDMU)</em><em> and synthesizes themes from the book and public talks.</em></p>
<h2 id="curated-weave-book-first">Curated weave (book-first)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“I began to realize that my system was <strong>accumulating and storing energy</strong> across multiple sessions… there was an energetic momentum building across the sessions.”<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.10 §2 ¶4</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Energy accumulation reframes psychedelic work from episodic highlights to a long-arc training. The body–mind becomes a capacitor: each well-integrated session increases charge, later discharging as breakthroughs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>Deeper</em> states of consciousness are <em>higher</em> states of energy… to have <em>stable experience</em> of a given level of reality, one must <strong>acclimate to its energy</strong>.”<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.1 §12 ¶8</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Acclimation is both energetic and ethical: purification, lifestyle hygiene, and spacing sessions so the subtle body can rebuild coherence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our subtle energy system has to be <strong>conditioned and strengthened</strong> to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state.”<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.2 §0 ¶5</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>LSD’s longer window facilitates polishing the system that is learning to carry more current.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“An LSD session <strong>grinds slow but it grinds fine</strong>… time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering.”<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.1 §9 ¶4</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accumulation isn’t risk-free. Residual charge can ache and overheat the system between sessions, demanding careful integration and, sometimes, throttling back.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My sessions were so intense that… my system was having difficulty <strong>managing all this ‘extra’ energy</strong>… how do you integrate the new energetic being you are slowly becoming?”<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.10 §3 ¶11</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Behind the personal process is a wider field logic: choices generate energy that feeds back across minutes, years, and lives, amplifying the long-term arc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are <strong>self-generating fields of energy</strong> in a living universe… we are always creating our own experience.”<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.5 §5 ¶11</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>LSDMU ch.10 §2 ¶4</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Second, I began to realize that my system was <em>accumulating and storing energy</em> across multiple sessions, even though these sessions were sometimes months apart. […] My system was somehow storing energy activated in multiple sessions and then using that stored energy to generate these massive periodic breakthroughs. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §12 ¶8</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, there is an energetic aspect to this cycle of initiation. […] <em>Deeper</em> states of consciousness are <em>higher</em> states of energy. […] to have <em>stable experience</em> of a given level of reality, one must acclimate to its energy. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.2 §0 ¶5</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. […] They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §9 ¶4</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring […] <em>An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine.</em> […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.10 §3 ¶11</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This energy nourished me spiritually […] but it also became something of a problem. […] after the session ends it can leave your subtle energy system feeling stretched and achy. […] What do you do with all this energy that is continuously flowing into you in between your sessions […]?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.5 §5 ¶11</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The essence of the teaching was this: We are self-generating fields of energy in a living universe. We generate energy by making choices, and the universe responds to this energy. […] Some cycles took minutes, some years, some lifetimes.</p>

<p>One thing I found was that my body, my system, was <strong>storing energy over time</strong>… used it periodically to <strong>trigger breakthroughs</strong> into new levels of consciousness. […] It would take <strong>years</strong> to develop the power to access those deeper dimensions.<br />

<p>You have to <strong>prepare your body</strong> to go into those states… then take <strong>two or three months</strong> to absorb it… then I would open up again, and the process would repeat itself.<br />

<p>Every step deeper into the universe is a step into a <strong>higher bandwidth of energy</strong>… We have to literally <strong>become a being who can live at that level</strong>… That takes a lot of work.<br />
<a href="https://youtu.be/mG1uyBw0ucg?t=460">00:07:40</a>  — <em>Diamonds from Heaven: Exploring the Mind of the Universe</em> (2023-07-12) • 00:07:40</p>
<p>When a system has <strong>more and more energy</strong> poured into it… it reaches a <strong>bifurcation point</strong>… flips into a different organizational pattern.<br />

<p>Over time, this energetic resonance <strong>calmed down</strong>… The practice empowers the system… you move from <strong>110 volts to 240 volts</strong>—you activate circuits. If things calm down, the circuits remain but with <strong>less energy</strong> driving it.<br />

<p>I stopped first because my subtle energy system was <strong>running so hot</strong>… I was just <strong>running too much energy</strong>.<br />

<h2 id="notes-synthesis">Notes &amp; synthesis</h2>
<p>The book supplies the mechanism (storage across sessions, acclimation, polishing, and overload risk). The talks confirm the long charging curve (years), the bodily conditioning cycles (months), non-equilibrium tipping dynamics, and the practical ceiling that forced Bache to pause. Together they clarify <em>how</em> energy accumulates and <em>why</em> pacing/integration govern depth.</p>
