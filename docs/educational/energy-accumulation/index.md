*Bache argues that psychedelic practice doesn’t just produce isolated peaks—it **stores** energetic momentum across sessions, requiring acclimation, hygiene, and pacing to stabilize deeper states.*

*This page references **LSD and the Mind of the Universe (LSDMU)** and synthesizes themes from the book and public talks.*


## Curated weave (book-first)

> “I began to realize that my system was **accumulating and storing energy** across multiple sessions… there was an energetic momentum building across the sessions.”  
— **LSDMU ch.10 §2 ¶4**

Energy accumulation reframes psychedelic work from episodic highlights to a long-arc training. The body–mind becomes a capacitor: each well-integrated session increases charge, later discharging as breakthroughs.

> “*Deeper* states of consciousness are *higher* states of energy… to have *stable experience* of a given level of reality, one must **acclimate to its energy**.”  
— **LSDMU ch.1 §12 ¶8**

Acclimation is both energetic and ethical: purification, lifestyle hygiene, and spacing sessions so the subtle body can rebuild coherence.

> “Our subtle energy system has to be **conditioned and strengthened** to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state.”  
— **LSDMU ch.2 §0 ¶5**

LSD’s longer window facilitates polishing the system that is learning to carry more current.

> “An LSD session **grinds slow but it grinds fine**… time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering.”  
— **LSDMU ch.1 §9 ¶4**

Accumulation isn’t risk-free. Residual charge can ache and overheat the system between sessions, demanding careful integration and, sometimes, throttling back.

> “My sessions were so intense that… my system was having difficulty **managing all this ‘extra’ energy**… how do you integrate the new energetic being you are slowly becoming?”  
— **LSDMU ch.10 §3 ¶11**

Behind the personal process is a wider field logic: choices generate energy that feeds back across minutes, years, and lives, amplifying the long-term arc.

> “We are **self-generating fields of energy** in a living universe… we are always creating our own experience.”  
— **LSDMU ch.5 §5 ¶11**

## Primary citations (book — verbatim excerpts)

**LSDMU ch.10 §2 ¶4**  
> Second, I began to realize that my system was *accumulating and storing energy* across multiple sessions, even though these sessions were sometimes months apart. […] My system was somehow storing energy activated in multiple sessions and then using that stored energy to generate these massive periodic breakthroughs. […]

**LSDMU ch.1 §12 ¶8**  
> As I mentioned earlier, there is an energetic aspect to this cycle of initiation. […] *Deeper* states of consciousness are *higher* states of energy. […] to have *stable experience* of a given level of reality, one must acclimate to its energy. […]

**LSDMU ch.2 §0 ¶5**  
> […] Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. […] They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.

**LSDMU ch.1 §9 ¶4**  
> […] the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring […] *An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine.* […]

**LSDMU ch.10 §3 ¶11**  
> This energy nourished me spiritually […] but it also became something of a problem. […] after the session ends it can leave your subtle energy system feeling stretched and achy. […] What do you do with all this energy that is continuously flowing into you in between your sessions […]?

**LSDMU ch.5 §5 ¶11**  
> The essence of the teaching was this: We are self-generating fields of energy in a living universe. We generate energy by making choices, and the universe responds to this energy. […] Some cycles took minutes, some years, some lifetimes.

## Supporting transcript quotes (verbatim)

> One thing I found was that my body, my system, was **storing energy over time**… used it periodically to **trigger breakthroughs** into new levels of consciousness. […] It would take **years** to develop the power to access those deeper dimensions.

> You have to **prepare your body** to go into those states… then take **two or three months** to absorb it… then I would open up again, and the process would repeat itself.

> Every step deeper into the universe is a step into a **higher bandwidth of energy**… We have to literally **become a being who can live at that level**… That takes a lot of work.

> When a system has **more and more energy** poured into it… it reaches a **bifurcation point**… flips into a different organizational pattern.

> Over time, this energetic resonance **calmed down**… The practice empowers the system… you move from **110 volts to 240 volts**—you activate circuits. If things calm down, the circuits remain but with **less energy** driving it.

> I stopped first because my subtle energy system was **running so hot**… I was just **running too much energy**.

## Notes & synthesis
The book supplies the mechanism (storage across sessions, acclimation, polishing, and overload risk). The talks confirm the long charging curve (years), the bodily conditioning cycles (months), non-equilibrium tipping dynamics, and the practical ceiling that forced Bache to pause. Together they clarify *how* energy accumulates and *why* pacing/integration govern depth.
