<p>“As one moves deeper into transcendence, the quality of light changes… Light becomes LIGHT. Clarity becomes Hyper-Clarity… I am attempting to describe a particular quality of light, a singularly intense dimension of light.”<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.10 §0 ¶7</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bache names this apex <strong>Diamond Luminosity</strong>, identifying it with Buddhism’s <em>dharmakāya</em>, the Clear Light of Absolute Reality. Its immediacy eclipses every prior attainment and redirects the whole project toward returning to this domain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Buddhism calls this radiance <em>dharmakaya</em>… I call it the domain of Diamond Luminosity… Its clarity was so overwhelming… returning to it became my sole focus.”<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.10 §0 ¶11</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This light is not merely seen; it <strong>reconfigures identity</strong>. Lives condense into a single, super-clear individuality—the <em>diamond soul</em>—a fusion that exceeds any egoic frame.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All my earthly lives were rewound… until I exploded in a burst of light… giving birth to what I have come to call the <em>Diamond Soul</em>… ‘a defined speck of infinitely dense, infinitely transparent Diamond Light.’”<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.8 §1 ¶36</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The transformation continues as clarity <strong>penetrates embodiment</strong>, reframing ordinary perception.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Light… had now penetrated even my physical senses… This was Diamond Vision… as if what had passed as seeing before was a crude approximation of the real thing.”<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.11 §1 ¶36</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet, even here, the path opens <strong>beyond</strong>—a pivot that discloses further reaches of Light, signaling an unending ascent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I could not imagine anything more… But… there are dimensions of Light beyond even this… We are truly children waking in the arms of an infinite cosmos.”<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.10 §2 ¶32</strong></p>

<p><strong>LSDMU ch.10 §0 ¶7</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my experience, there are many gradations of light. As one moves deeper into transcendence, the quality of light changes. It becomes clearer, more intense, and more luminous, calling for a new vocabulary of light. Light becomes LIGHT. Clarity becomes Hyper-Clarity. When I speak in this chapter of the Diamond Luminosity or the Diamond Light, I am not using a colorful metaphor to describe the light. I am attempting to describe a particular quality of light, a singularly intense dimension of light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.10 §0 ¶11</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Diamond Light that exploded from my chest in session 38 was the forerunner of what emerged in full splendor now. After going through yet one more intense cycle of death and rebirth, I was taken into a brilliantly clear, supremely luminous radiance. Buddhism calls this radiance <em>dharmakaya</em>—the Clear Light of Absolute Reality. I call it the domain of Diamond Luminosity. This Luminosity captivated me so completely that it extinguished any interest in continuing to explore the other levels of existence that had previously fascinated me. This was a different order of reality altogether. Its clarity was so overwhelming, its energy so pure that returning to it became my sole focus in future sessions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.8 §1 ¶36</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In earlier sessions, I had been taken beyond linear time and given an experience of my present life as a completed whole. Now eleven years later, I was taken into a deeper condition in which all my earthly lives were rewound one by one, like winding kite string around a spool, until I exploded in a burst of light, fusing all the strands into one and giving birth to what I have come to call the <em>Diamond Soul</em>. It was both me and more than I have ever been. Composed of many lifetimes, it was more than the sum of all their years. In coming together, a burst of energy was generated that fused all these centuries of experience into a single being. I was an individual but an individual beyond any frame of reference I had previously known. I was <em>“a defined speck of infinitely dense, infinitely transparent Diamond Light.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.11 §1 ¶36</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recognized what was happening. The Diamond Clarity that I had previously experienced in the subtle domains of transpersonal reality had now penetrated even my physical senses. Everywhere I get hints of the larger progression. The Light has been working its way deeper into my embodied being, deconstructing my psychological conditioning, my subtle energy system, and now even my physical perception. This was Diamond Vision. It was as if I was truly seeing for the first time in my life, as if what had passed as seeing before was simply a crude approximation of the real thing. How could I have ever accepted that gauzy curtain as real seeing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.10 §1 ¶1</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once one has entered the Diamond Luminosity, the hunger to return to it is overwhelming. Nothing else feels worth pursuing. The joys that previous sessions had opened to me paled by comparison. How does one describe the freedom of becoming Light, of eclipsing so radically the limitations of space and time? The poetry of Rumi and Hafiz took on new significance for me, for I had become a hopeless lover of the divine condition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.10 §2 ¶32</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the Diamond Luminosity first opened, it had carried such a powerful sense of completion and homecoming that I thought I had finally found what I was looking for. I could not imagine anything more fulfilling or complete than the Pure Light of Diamond Luminosity. And indeed, I did find my personal stopping point here. But at the very moment of reaching this pinnacle, this session showed me that there are dimensions of existence beyond even this. I saw that there are more dimensions of Light than I will ever be able to explore in this lifetime, even using this powerful method. There is simply not enough time, and I do not have enough strength to touch them all. We are truly children waking in the arms of an infinite cosmos.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Diamond Luminosity I experienced is… an extra-samsaric reality—beyond cyclic existence, beyond the Bardo… beyond all deities, archetypes, or any dimension we normally encounter.<br />

<p>When I call it diamond consciousness or diamond luminosity, I’m pointing to a particular quality of light: ultra, ultra clear—beyond imagination… The closest analogue I found is Buddhism’s Dharmakaya—the clear light of absolute reality.<br />

<p>In Session 50… my visual field pivoted 90 degrees… a ray of light from that further reality hit me and shattered me… I call it the Absolute Light… It showed me the journey is infinite; there is no final point.<br />

<p>Lives fused… there was an explosion of diamond light from my chest… I wasn’t Chris Bache; I was a being of which Chris was a part… the birth of the diamond soul.<br />

<p>Over the last five years—26 sessions—I was taken into diamond luminosity four times… those immersions are the true “diamonds from heaven,” the most important takeaway.<br />

<p>The book anchors DL as <em>dharmakāya</em>—a phenomenology of ultra-clarity with transformative force. Transcripts confirm three pivots: (1) <strong>ontological placement</strong> (extra-saṃsāric), (2) <strong>teleology</strong> (diamond soul formation and embodiment), and (3) <strong>open-ended cosmology</strong> (Absolute Light → infinite progression). Minor wording varies, but the arc is consistent.</p>
