    <p><em>How Bache frames the collective psyche and archetypal domains: from META-COEX healing to an ontologically prior “bridge” that seeds space-time, with evolving archetypes and participatory disclosure.</em></p>
<p><em>This page references </em><em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe (LSDMU)</em><em> and synthesizes themes from the book and public talks.</em></p>
<h2 id="curated-weave-book-first">Curated weave (book-first)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a</em> cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. […] It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.1 §8 ¶7</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bache shifts the center of gravity from private healing to the <em>deep psyche</em>. At depth, personal dynamics mirror species dynamics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The collective psyche appears to organize its memories […] into <em>giant memory clusters</em>. […] I call these collective memory clusters META-COEX systems.<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.4 §2 ¶6</strong></p>
<p>This interpretation proposes that the working of the collective psyche parallels the working of the personal psyche […]. […] In this setting, an individual seems to be able to tap into and directly facilitate a healing of some portion of the collective psyche.<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.6 §1 ¶5</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mechanism: as COEX systems structure the personal unconscious, META-COEX structures the collective; high-energy sessions can catalyze species-level clearing. What domain are we in?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I experienced archetypal reality to be a bridge between the physical universe and the source of existence […] the seed reality of space-time. […] The archetypal domain is actually a cluster of levels.<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.7 §0 ¶8</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this bridge, archetypes aren’t static molds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I] use the term in a quasi-Jungian sense […] patterns in the collective unconscious […]. […] I see the collective psyche as itself learning and evolving over time, and therefore I see archetypes at this level as evolving over time.<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.7 §10 ¶4</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Participation matters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All psychedelic disclosure is interactive. […] Our being evokes the portion of the universe we experience […].<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.1 §9 ¶2</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taken together: a participatory passage from personal COEX to collective META-COEX, through a living, evolving archetypal bridge that informs—and learns from—our species-mind.</p>

<p><strong>LSDMU ch.4 §2 ¶6</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The collective psyche appears to organize its memories in ways that parallel how the personal unconscious organizes its memories. […] It appears to gather the memories of humanity into <em>giant memory clusters</em> […] I call these collective memory clusters META-COEX systems. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.6 §1 ¶5</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This interpretation proposes that the working of the collective psyche parallels the working of the personal psyche in key respects. […] In this setting, an individual seems to be able to tap into and directly facilitate a healing of some portion of the collective psyche. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.7 §0 ¶8</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I experienced archetypal reality to be a bridge between the physical universe and the source of existence. […] Being ontologically prior to space-time in the Great Chain of Being, it is the seed reality of space-time. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.7 §10 ¶4</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Second, I use the term in a quasi-Jungian sense to describe patterns in the collective unconscious of humanity—patterns of collective memory, collective thought, collective learning, and even collective physiology. […] I see the collective psyche as itself learning and evolving over time, and therefore I see archetypes at this level as evolving over time. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §9 ¶2</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>All psychedelic disclosure is interactive. […] Our being evokes the portion of the universe we experience in these states, and the more conditioning we have let go of […] the more open-ended and far-reaching are the experiences that present themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>(Optional, contextual) LSDMU ch.7 §7 ¶9</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experiencing human existence as a completely unified field made everything much easier to understand. […] I was now experiencing as a centralized decision to incarnate entire generations to cleanse the human mind-field of its collective karmic legacy. […]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my experience, there were two archetypal levels: a high subtle level and a low subtle level. At the high subtle level—what I think of as Platonic—I encountered living forms responsible for creating spacetime […]. At the lower subtle, more Jungian level, I entered into the living tissue of the collective psyche. […] As we heal ourselves, we contribute to healing the collective psyche.<br />

<p>Where I went next was into the greater realm of archetypal reality. […] I entered a state of awareness beyond the collective psyche, and at that level I was being worked with, taught how reality functions.<br />

<p>At a lower level of archetypal reality—call it a Jungian level—I repeatedly experienced the human psyche and the human species as a single integrated organism […]. The individual is real; the collective is real. They operate on different scales and are mutually implicated.<br />

<p>My focus wasn’t on groups but on all of humanity. […] Each of our minds is like a fractal spark within a species mind; each of our bodies a cell within an integrated body of humanity. […] Very similar to Rupert Sheldrake’s morphic fields theory.<br />

<p>Why isn’t this just echoes of my personal unconscious […]? […] The cosmology that emerges in psychedelic states is echoed in the work of other psychedelicists […] There is a convergence of experience at deep levels.<br />

<p>As one goes deeper, the granular quality of many individual beings yields to levels that are less granular […] and then opens into vast tracts of consciousness that are less individual and less entity-like.<br />

<p>When I entered into archetypal reality and died as a human being—died to my species identity—[…] I moved into increasingly clear, contentless states of consciousness […] beyond archetypal reality.<br />

<h2 id="notes-synthesis">Notes &amp; synthesis</h2>
<p>Book passages establish the ontology (archetypal as seed/bridge) and mechanism (COEX → META-COEX; participatory disclosure). Transcripts confirm two archetypal tiers (high/Platonic vs low/Jungian), add species-organism imagery, and clarify that entities/thought-forms thin out with depth. Together they depict evolving archetypes within a learning species-mind.</p>
