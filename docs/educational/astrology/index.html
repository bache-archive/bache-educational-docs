    <p><em>Bache affirms the Grof–Tarnas astrological hypothesis as plausible, offers his session dates for scrutiny, and notes that any correlations may weaken as work moves into deeper transpersonal ranges.</em></p>
<p><em>This page references </em><em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe (LSDMU)</em><em> and synthesizes themes from the book and public talks.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Stan Grof and Richard Tarnas have proposed the bold hypothesis that people’s experiences in deep nonordinary states move in synchrony with the rhythms of our solar system. […] Grof has argued that natal and transit astrology can illumine and even predict the tenor of one’s psychedelic session on any given day. This is too large a topic for me to take up here, but […] I will give my birth information and the dates of all my sessions in appendix II.”<br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.1 §6 ¶3</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bache positions astrology as a live question adjacent to his project, not its center. In talks, he acknowledges the Grof–Tarnas correlations and finds them intuitively compatible with a universe that “has a pulse,” while keeping his primary focus on cosmology rather than forecasting session tone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I completely accept the proposal they’ve made. […] It makes sense that the rhythm of the universe would be part of the rhythm of this intelligence.”<br />

</blockquote>
<p>At the same time, he reports a <strong>roll-off</strong>: as his sessions moved beyond archetypal ranges toward Dharmakaya/Diamond Luminosity, astrological variables seemed less predictive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When I began to enter deeper and deeper into archetypal reality, and then beyond […] I felt a roll-off of astrological variables. […] I know there are correlations, particularly in the early stages of one’s work. Whether those correlations continue to be as strong in the later stages, I’m not as convinced.”<br />

</blockquote>
<p>He occasionally frames this in eco-spiritual terms—a solar/galactic “pulse” one can learn to read—without claiming personal mastery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Resurgence of interest in astrology—not a naive, mechanistic astrology, but the vision that the universe has a pulse to it. The galaxies have a pulse, our solar system has a pulse, and if you know how to read that pulse, you can feel how your body and destiny unfold in rhythm with it.”<br />

<blockquote>
<p>There may be another factor that influences what emerges in our sessions. Because our solar system is constantly moving, the variable of planetary setting changes in subtle ways from day to day and month to month. In a collaboration of many years, Stan Grof and Richard Tarnas have proposed the bold hypothesis that people’s experiences in deep nonordinary states move in synchrony with the rhythms of our solar system. Using case histories, Grof has argued that natal and transit astrology can illumine and even predict the tenor of one’s psychedelic session on any given day. This is too large a topic for me to take up here, but in the interest of encouraging this discussion, I will give my birth information and the dates of all my sessions in appendix II at the end of the book.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Good question, and a complicated one. Rick Tarnas is a good friend, as is Stan, and I'm aware of Stan's writing and his analysis of cases and the astrological correlations of people going through breakthroughs. […] I completely accept the proposal they've made. […] It makes sense. […] There would be a kind of solar system pulse in the nature of our experiences.<br />

<p>When my work began to go off the edge of time and space—[…] into Dharmakaya or the Diamond Luminosity—I felt a roll-off of astrological variables. […] Whether those correlations continue to be as strong in the later stages, I'm not as convinced.<br />

<p>We can see this in the resurgence of interest in astrology—not a naive, mechanistic astrology, but the vision that the universe has a pulse to it. […] If you know how to read that pulse, you can feel how your body and destiny unfold in rhythm with it.<br />

<h2 id="notes-synthesis">Notes &amp; synthesis</h2>
<p>Book-first, Bache defers detailed analysis to Grof/Tarnas and offers data (session dates) for future study. Transcripts confirm openness to correlations early on, paired with caution that predictiveness may diminish as sessions enter supra-archetypal states. Net: astrology remains an <strong>invited inquiry</strong>, not a pillar.</p>
