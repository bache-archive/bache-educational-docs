    <p><em>Bache’s Sessions 11–17 move beyond personal therapy into a species-scale purification that opens—only after endurance—into “Deep Time.”</em></p>
<p><em>This page references </em><em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe (LSDMU)</em><em> and synthesizes themes from the book and public talks.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a</em> cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. […] <em>the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.</em><br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.1 §8 ¶7</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He warns readers to expect something larger than personal healing. Sessions 11–17 inaugurate a phase he later names the <em>Ocean of Suffering</em>—difficult installments that nonetheless function like initiations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The encounter with the ocean of suffering lasted fourteen sessions […] a year before the six-year break and a year after it […]. From the perspective of the experiences themselves, this six-year interruption was a mere bump in the road that changed nothing.</em><br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.4 §0 ¶8</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first, he misreads the ordeal as unfinished ego death; gradually, its scope reveals itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Accordingly, when the ocean of suffering opened […] I interpreted it to mean that some stubborn remnant of my ego […] was unfinished. […] Eventually I recognized that the death-rebirth cycle was repeating itself at deeper levels of consciousness.</em><br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.6 §1 ¶2; ch.6 §1 ¶10</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The work arrives in waves—tense anticipations, then hours-long purifications—separated by months to digest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Once I learned what was waiting for me […] the mornings of a session day were tense. […] Carol called it “going into the tunnel.”</em><br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.4 §0 ¶7</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As capacity grows, the field widens from personal to collective, then breaks through.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My consciousness was […] opening to more and more suffering […] tens of thousands of people. […] I reached more deeply into the suffering and eventually broke through to this larger dimension.</em><br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.6 §0 ¶34</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What justifies such descent is what follows it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Ocean of Suffering was a terrible ordeal to endure, but each time I emerged from it I entered a reality […] where the rules of time had changed—into what I first called “whole time” and later Deep Time.</em><br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.5 §0 ¶3</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And why suffering at all?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It’s not that the universe wants us to suffer […] there is a certain suffering inherent in repeatedly shedding our psychological skin in order to enter more deeply into the universe.</em><br />
— <strong>LSDMU ch.1 §12 ¶10</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a</em> cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. […] <em>It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.</em></p>

<p><strong>LSDMU ch.4 §0 ¶8</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The encounter with the ocean of suffering lasted fourteen sessions spread over two years of work. […] From the perspective of the experiences themselves, this six-year interruption was a mere bump in the road that changed nothing.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.6 §1 ¶2</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Accordingly, when the ocean of suffering opened after what had appeared to be a solid ego-death […] I interpreted it to mean that some stubborn remnant of my ego must have slipped through the therapeutic net […] I thought that this collective suffering would eventually lead to a more complete ego-death.</em></p>

<p><strong>LSDMU ch.6 §0 ¶34</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My consciousness was expanding and opening to more and more suffering. […] I reached more deeply into the suffering and eventually broke through to this larger dimension.</em></p>

<p><em>The Ocean of Suffering was a terrible ordeal to endure, but each time I emerged from it I entered a reality that was stunning and intoxicating […] into what I first called “whole time” and later</em> Deep Time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It took me about two and a half years to go through what Stan Grof calls the perinatal dimension […] Then the ocean of suffering began. […] Eventually […] I concluded it wasn’t aimed at my personal transformation at all. It was aimed at healing the human species.<br />

<p>The ocean of suffering was much harder and more demanding than dissolving my personal ego. […] There’s a rhythm: purification, then ecstasy. […] The deeper the purification, the deeper the blessings.<br />

<p>When I first began to enter the ocean of suffering […] each session tended to divide into two halves: a purification half followed by an ecstatic half.<br />

<p>The ocean of suffering lasted two years and 14 sessions […] After the break, the ocean of suffering picked up exactly where it had left off.<br />

<p>Beyond personal and soul-level unfinished business, you can encounter trauma that is species-wide. […] By letting humanity’s suffering enter full awareness, a transformation takes place that registers in the individual, but also—this is my hypothesis—registers in the species as a whole.<br />

<p>I don’t think everyone has to go into it. […] I think my soul chose to do this before I was born. […] The universe more than rewarded me for this phase.<br />

<h2 id="notes-synthesis">Notes &amp; synthesis</h2>
<p>The book anchors the Ocean as a two-year, fourteen-session curriculum: installments of purification that reliably open into instruction (Deep Time). Transcripts confirm the mechanism (purification → ecstasy), the species-level intent, and the striking continuity across a six-year hiatus, while adding the “soul’s choice” nuance that this path is not prescriptive for all.</p>
