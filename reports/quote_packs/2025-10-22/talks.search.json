      "text": "ng been through what you’ve been through, how do you see these times laid into what you experienced?\nChris Bache:\nJumping many years ahead, I summarized my experiences of our time in a chapter called “The Birth of the Future Human.” Over many years, I was given visions of humanity coming to a turning point, a spiritual breakthrough—an evolutionary shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche. In 1995, I dissolved into the species mind, into what I call deep time, taken into the future where I experienced a death-and-rebirth of the human family—not as individuals, but humanity as a whole. It was a global systems crisis precipitated by escalating ecological crises. I wasn’t given details, dates, nothing about artificial intelligence or a third world war—just the experience of a prolonged loss of control and a collapse of everything considered normal and necessary. Since then, I’ve lived with this awareness. For me, it’s not a projected fantasy; it’s an experience, so I don’t question its truth. I see this period as one of increasing destabilization: conflicts between races, religions, sexes, classes—tremendous things we’ve done to each other for thousands of years. We have to grow spiritually into the next form emerging in the human. I think this process will continue to deepen for decades. What’s unfolding now is the overture, bringing to the surface age-old hatreds that we must transform. I don’t offer political solutions; my perspective isn’t ground-level. It’s from far above the Earth, looking at the long evolutionary trajectory.",

That dominant vision took me far into humanity’s evolutionary future.\n\nJef Baker: What insights did that window of deep time give you about our future direction?\n\nChris Bache: Starting around the 23rd session, and then in a punctuated way over the years, the universe kept giving me teachings about the human story—what you might call the master story. I don’t mean that arrogantly; it’s simply what kept coming. It emphasized we were approaching a crescendo—a true turning point, a before-and-after in our evolutionary journey. After thousands and hundreds of thousands of years of struggling—in a reincarnational framework, which I accept—the message was that humanity was coming to a decisive pivot in its larger story.",

I thought it was about personal transformation, even personal enlightenment. I never imagined that the evolution of the species would become such a dominant theme. Going back to about halfway through the work in the early ’90s, starting in 1991, I began to have a series of visions—just dropped into my sessions—that humanity was coming to a turning point, a true before-and-after point in history. We were entering a time of intense purification, essentially purifying the human psyche of the sins of our fathers—lifting the conditioning of the past to make us more receptive to, and capable of internalizing, the spiritual infusion, insights, and power becoming available at this time in history. There was a tremendous sense of rebirth coming.",

      "text": "’s Day. What do we create as our soul priorities for 2025 that would help move this process forward?\nChris Bache:\nA couple of background assumptions. One: this transition will take the entire resources of the human family. There is no one formula. It will take everything we have—scientific knowledge, economic knowledge, political skills, educational skills, medical skills—to move us through. Two: based on years of studying the past-life literature, my assumption is that each of us has chosen where and when to incarnate with a certain prevision of what we’re getting into—what will be the dominant themes of that incarnation and the resources available within it. This is part of our incarnational psychic makeup. That means each of us is already positioned by our soul to make a contribution to this transition. So it’s not a matter of looking around outside of oneself; it’s a matter of looking deeply into where we are and what we are. The key question is not “What can I do?” The key question is “Will I have the courage to do what is within my reach to do?” If everybody does what is within their reach, we will make it through.",

      "text": "speaking on so many topics. I wonder if there's anything else that you'd like to say or talk about.\nChris Bache:\nWe are coming into a hard time in history. We're coming into a time when, decade by decade, things are going to be getting worse and worse. There will be tremendous social anxiety and personal anxiety as we basically inherit the consequences of our abuse of the Earth for all the hundreds of years that we've been creating this extractive economy. But I hope, in everybody's own individual spiritual practices, one encounters enough of the universe to experience the profound wisdom—the great intelligence—that's behind this moment of transformation, and the great compassion and love that's behind this time in our history. We are not victims. This is not an accident. It is a time that calls for us to become the heroes that we have the possibility of being—nothing less than deep, deep heroic sacrifice and actualization is called for. But the universe will support us. Every time we make a change to live to the larger good, the universe will support us. It will help us overcome our shortcomings. This is the game of life. This is the great time of our life. In the end, we don't want to live a comfortable life so much as we want to live a life that's meaningful, and this is going to give us all an opportunity to live very meaningful lives.",

I should speak out of my visionary experience, because my sense of this is informed primarily by that.\n\nThese visions took place for me going back to 1990 through 1995–96. I was very ecologically uninformed 25 years ago when they occurred. When I first had the experience of the death and rebirth of humanity, it took me about a year to recover. I felt like I was walking around Hiroshima a week before the bomb was to be dropped—knowing what was coming—with profound compassion and deep respect for all human beings on the planet, knowing they had all volunteered to participate in this grand exercise and, at a deep soul level, knew what was coming even if at an egoic level they did not.

Looking around, for every indicator we were getting better, there were indicators we were getting worse—more insanity, greed, corporate control. Then in 1995 I was given a very deep session, a series of visions that took me into the future. Time became very permeable in my sessions; I entered multiple modalities of trans-temporal experience. I entered the deep future and experienced what I came to understand as the death and rebirth of our entire species in a collective historical crescendo. I experienced it not as Chris Bache looking on, and not even as a spiritual aspect of myself looking on. By then I had dissolved so many times into the collective mind that I experienced this crisis as the species. I felt a rippling of crisis arising within the collective psyche, a time of tremendous suffering—things falling apart, loss of control, human beings losing more and more of the constants of their world.

I thought my work was a personal journey—healing, awakening. Then it broadened into an individual’s insight into the deep structure of our lives. But starting around 1990 through 1995, I began receiving a series of internally consistent visions about humanity’s evolutionary destiny: where we were in our journey, that we were coming to a turning point, a crescendo that would catalyze a tremendous transformation inside humanity—a true before-and-after moment in time. A profound spiritual transformation was coming to a head. This kept repeating itself in my work in different ways, but I didn’t know how the universe was going to pull it off.",
