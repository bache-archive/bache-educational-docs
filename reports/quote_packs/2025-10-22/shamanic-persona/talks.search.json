Our previous psychedelic knowledge and the identity based on it must surrender control before a deeper mode of knowing can emerge and stabilize. What’s dying in these sessions, then, is sometimes the shamanic persona; its death may feel personal, but it’s not the ego—rather, a deeper individual identity birthed through previous sessions. One shamanic persona may die and be reborn multiple times; after the transition, the new persona retains the memories of the former and adds to them from this new, deeper level. When an even deeper level opens, the current persona must die and yield again.",

Sometimes, however, we meet deities that are not part of our lineage and perhaps not even in our awareness. They can appear completely out of left field, yet take the recognizable cultural form of a deity—Ganesh, Jesus, Mary, the Prophet Muhammad, and others.",

Would you like to say more?\nChris Bache:\nMy first concern was that it sounded like ego gone amok—ego inflation. I had to sit with that a long time, because my experiences told me that’s not what was happening. As you said, it’s a very different worldview. In the classic individual patient model, the individual is having experiences. The individual has transpersonal experiences, and the individual is always at the center. In this model, my individual existence was completely secondary. It becomes not a matter of my being central. I got the system started, but I dissolved completely into preexisting fields of consciousness. Those fields are the dynamic force having the experiences.\n\nThat manifested not only in the ocean of suffering, but later in archetypal reality and causal oneness. In many experiences, Chris Bache was a bit player. In the book I have an appendix: what dies and is reborn? After so many deaths and rebirths, it becomes a cognitive question. What is actually dying? It feels personal. Is it just ego dying over and over?",

It has changed some. Was it Huston Smith who said, “A mystic learns to swim in waters that the psychotic drowns in”?\n\nLuc Briede-Cooper:\nI think that was Joseph Campbell.\n\nChris Bache:\nWhat we have in common is opening into a reality beyond private or personal reality—a larger expanse that can be very destructive if you’re not ready. It can be injurious, traumatic, tumultuous; it can churn things up just opening to collective dimensions. That’s why, like all psychedelic therapists, I emphasize accessing these dimensions in carefully controlled circumstances with therapeutic support. This work is not advisable for a wide range of people; it’s not universally safe. It depends on many variables. There are screening criteria to identify good candidates, and that’s just part of the regimen.",

Is that a fair representation?\nChris Bache\nIt is, and that description fits better in the early stages, when you’re working at insights that help you understand your individual way of being in the world. I describe my work fundamentally as cosmological exploration—where not only do you leave your individual ego behind (at least temporarily), but you leave deeper and deeper levels behind and are given the opportunity to explore how the universe constructs its reality: how archetypal reality structures time-and-space reality, how oneness manifests in the diversity of all physical life forms—down to atomic, nuclear, quantum levels—how the pure void of emptiness is that mysterious, fertile essence giving birth to time and space, moment by moment. It is useful to understand your personal ways of contracting and sustaining your smallness, but for me—trained as a philosopher—I wanted to understand the larger spectrum of reality. The invitation I was given was to explore how time and space are made. I often wished I had a PhD in physics or astrophysics—I could have understood so much more of what I was being shown. The universe can only communicate to you what you have the capacity to understand.",

You sit deep in this chamber around a fire; the ladder is pulled up; you stay isolated all night doing ceremony until morning, when the ladder is lowered again. I use it as a metaphor for a good psychedelic session. You’re totally isolated from the world. You don’t get up and move around or talk a lot. Whatever you’re confronting is coming from within or through yourself, not being triggered by outside stimuli.\n\nTasshin Fogleman:\nThere’s a question on my mind about your work. It’s almost as if you’re presenting cosmological findings. I find them persuasive and consistent with my own explorations, but why should someone take these findings seriously as saying something about the nature of reality, rather than just an inner adventure?",

We’re hardwired into the collective psyche—physically, biologically, mentally, spiritually. Everything we do registers in the collective, and the collective shapes everything we do. An extreme example: when I die, I take my psychedelic experiences with me, but the species mind keeps them too, because I was human when I had them. They become part of the human family’s experience. This is true for all of us. Harm registers; healing registers. Insights, care, compassion infuse the network of life that is the human family, and beyond.\n\nThe spiritual traditions say there’s no such thing as private spiritual practice. In Buddhism, you begin practice by cultivating bodhicitta—the aspiration to benefit all sentient beings—and end by distributing the merit to all levels of being. The trap is thinking it’s about personal enlightenment. The traditions say the opposite: it’s not about you; it’s all of us. Open your heart and mind, let the pain in, bring the healing out. We can trust that everything we do is conserved and used by other beings alive now.",

And I want to say this—there’s a lot of discussion about psychedelics and enlightenment: do psychedelics lead to enlightenment? Are they counterproductive or productive? These adventures were not aimed at enlightenment; I mean, they started that way. I started because I was interested in enlightenment—I thought I could do these sessions, ego would die, and I’d get to enlightenment faster. But that changed quickly. After my first ego death, instead of personal transformation, the story opened up into a story of deep collective transformation. I began to enter what I call the ocean of suffering—what the Buddhists call the hell realms—deep suffering still living within the collective psyche. This went on for two years, over many sessions and years, involving so many people that it eventually shattered my perception of what was going on. It wasn't aimed at my personal transformation but at the transformation of some aspect of humanity’s collective unconscious. After that culminated, I entered into archetypal reality. In that phase, I had to cease to be a human being. I discovered that there is a human identity deeper than your individual identity. Just as I had to die as Chris Bache to become something larger, I had to die as a human per se and go completely outside of any frame of reference of humanity to move into what I determined were different dimensions of archetypal reality. Every step deeper is a step into much more intense energy. In the beginning, it can be shattering and hard to maintain coherent awareness. But I found that if I went back again, systematically—about five times a year—over time you go through a purification and clarification process. You learn how to stay conscious at levels of reality where, at first, you could not remain conscious—you have to practice.",
