      "text": "ich the universe gets to experience itself in a way it otherwise wouldn’t? What do you think we are?\nChris Bache: That question has many levels, depending on how we frame it. We are clearly part of the creative experiment that the universe is—an aspect of it, not separate from it. Our body—the cells of our biology—arises out of this evolutionary masterpiece. Our mind, like our body, derives from the universe. We’re taught the universe is a machine that moves with blindness, evolving through random variation and selection, but that’s an incomplete story. Sink into the depths of your mind and you drop out of personal mind into deeper layers—the species mind, then a solar system or galactic mind. As you drop into that, you encounter an intelligence of stunning vastness, with a depth of love and compassion behind it. That intelligence manifests the universe as its own self‑expression. We are fortunate to be cells within this body of divine self‑manifestation, fractally embedded in it, our story part of its story and vice versa.",

      "text": "he universe is galaxies, stars, vast physical space. What do you mean by “universe” in your account?\nChris Bache\nYou’re absolutely right to press me on this. I struggle with language to describe these realities. I don’t like using the word “God”—it carries so much historical baggage and usually doesn’t mean what I mean. Sometimes I use “the divine,” but that can be a bit of a ruse because it comes back to the same issue. I collect images of galaxies and nebulas and play them in meditation because this is my divine; it’s what I’m orienting to. But what I’m referring to is not the outer body of the divine, though I was taken into exploring some of the body of the universe. I’m talking about the consciousness of the universe—the consciousness that has given birth to the universe. I’m just scraping the edges of it, touching pieces of it, and my experience is limited by what I can understand. I often wish I had degrees in astrophysics and quantum theory; this consciousness could have shown me so much more if my mind were tuned to that type of knowledge. What I would love is to have a hundred of our best scientists, artists, and social activists going into these states in a systematic fashion. Imagine a protocol: one day a month for two years—what body of knowledge they would return with and share. It’s never the experience of any one individual that’s most important; it’s our collective genius engaged together.",

When we open ourselves in deep psychedelic states, it’s as if our mind is a seed-catalyst dropped into this ocean, and it crystallizes a set of experiences out of this infinite potential. By absorbing and internalizing what we’re being offered—what we’re being taught—we’re changed, purified, transformed inwardly. Then, when we drop that changed mind back into the infinite potential, it triggers an even deeper set of experiences from its infinity.\n\nI experienced myself as engaging an intelligence—a consciousness—that was directing my sessions.

Why do you believe that is the case?\nChris Bache:\nPart of my experience reflects a classic teaching in some Eastern traditions: the essence of the individual is the same as the essence of the totality—Atman is Brahman. Our nature is the nature of the divine, which is the nature of reality itself. So it’s not completely accurate to frame this as a duality between me and It. At a deeper level, my being is a fractal manifestation of Its reality. Our relationship is deeply essential and mutually participating from the start. But functionally, in terms of Chris Bache, I am so small and It is so vast that there’s a relative duality involved. And between my small bit and the totality are layers upon layers. It’s a very complex, organic system of massive scale.",

I was given a session I called the “Cosmic Tour,” where I was shown many things, much of which I couldn’t reproduce when I came back into time-space consciousness, because I didn’t have the vocabulary or intellectual tools to articulate them. I’ve often wished I had a PhD in physics or astrophysics to better articulate some of what I was given. But I didn’t spend a lot of time traveling within time and space.

Creation is intentional. I hesitate to use “design,” but there is an intelligence manifesting in time and space. We are part of this intelligence; our nature is of the same nature as its nature—Atman is Brahman. Reincarnation is a fact of life. We won’t get far trying to understand existence unless we understand the pulse of life—that our current life is just the most recent in many cycles of life and death. There is an underlying logic to our circumstances—what Buddhists and Hindus call karma—an intentionality working itself out in our lives. Our evolution is not driven solely by blind chance and mechanical processes; there is a deeper intelligence manifesting in our circumstances and challenges, inviting us to become more by the end of life than we were at the beginning. Those are a few touch points.",

From a reincarnation perspective, we’re always popping into time-space and popping out into a spiritual meta-universe, then back in and out again. From this perspective, what is death? All the enlightenment and awakening traditions say the same thing: birth is not the beginning of our life. Look carefully and you’ll find in your body and mind evidence of experience that far predates your physical life. Death is not the end, because we now have, especially through the work of people like Michael Newton on life-between-lives and past-life therapy, abundant evidence of a continuity of consciousness that predates and postdates our individual life.",

I describe my work fundamentally as cosmological exploration—where not only do you leave your individual ego behind (at least temporarily), but you leave deeper and deeper levels behind and are given the opportunity to explore how the universe constructs its reality: how archetypal reality structures time-and-space reality, how oneness manifests in the diversity of all physical life forms—down to atomic, nuclear, quantum levels—how the pure void of emptiness is that mysterious, fertile essence giving birth to time and space, moment by moment. It is useful to understand your personal ways of contracting and sustaining your smallness, but for me—trained as a philosopher—I wanted to understand the larger spectrum of reality.

Let me step back and put this in context. All the religions of the last 5,000 years—the Axial Age—came into existence when we first began to get beneath individual consciousness and tap into spiritual consciousness, the consciousness of the universe or the Divine. The religions of this era, both Western and Eastern, are examples of what I would call an up-and-out cosmology. I understand their intention: when you experientially touch your divine essence, it is so ecstatic and blissful—so much more satisfying than physical existence—that how could you not think you belong there more than here? So the theologies born in this period are theologies of return. They basically say we don’t belong on Earth; we belong in heaven. Somehow, through misfortune or punishment, we’re here, but what we should do is get out of here and go back there—whether through Western concepts of salvation or Eastern concepts of reincarnation leading to moksha, escape back to spiritual paradise.",

When we return to source, when we begin that journey back to point of origin, we are met by a massive supreme intelligence, extraordinary compassion and loving beyond imagination. And it is so happy that part of itself has come back to experience and know it. It wants to show you creation, show you what has been going on.

One unusual feature of my experiences, compared to others I've spoken with, is that I didn’t have much contact with individual beings, which are so common in the DMT experience. Over time I pondered why. I kept being dissolved into levels of being, then dissolved into deeper levels, opening into vast expanses of consciousness and learning how the universe works—not by engaging discrete beings who live on those levels. The closest I came to “beings,” as such, was in archetypal reality, but those realities were so large that the best my mind could do was image them as galaxies—billions of light-years across. They were profoundly foreign.",

But the core truth manifesting there—without mentioning psychedelics—is that consciousness is unified from the start. Everything we do in our individual field radiates 360 degrees. All of our spiritual practice, all of our actions, radiate and touch the consciousness of the beings around us. Knowing this, we take more responsibility for sending a positive, beneficial experience into the world. We are never isolated from those around us. It may be invisible or subtle, but it’s always there. The more we act on that basis, the more we activate the sinews that bind us to life. This is true not just for human beings—it’s true for all life forms that surround us. That’s the core teaching of The Living Classroom: there’s an atomistic quality to teaching, and a quantum quality. You and I have been having, in some ways, an atomistic conversation, but we can trust that there’s a quantum quality to it.",

The deeper your experience of the intelligence of life and the joy of its creative manifestation, the more you see the universe for what it is—the body of the Divine, the body of God. The universe manifests a profound intelligence. Once you touch that, you’re overwhelmed by its brilliance, wisdom, and love—an order of love beyond anything I’d known in this lifetime.\n\nThose experiences change how you see everything. And they give you a larger horizon to understand the human experience. I adopted reincarnation early on based on empirical evidence—reading Ian Stevenson and early past-life therapy work—but it still takes years to truly live into a universe that pulses in reincarnation cycles, not just for individuals but for the species.",

In my experience, when I’ve been drawn into a larger overview and encountered the intelligence behind this process, I find myself trusting beyond what I can understand. I trust because of the quality of the being I encounter behind these circumstances. I can’t understand all the pain behind all this. I can come up with any number of partial and incomplete theories for how it works, but in the end we’re brought to our knees trying to grasp it intellectually. If you experience the love and wisdom of the universe, it gives confidence that there truly is a logic to it. And I want to say: the universe is a hard taskmaster. Look at images of Kali the destroyer—she brings death and destruction in one hand and enlightenment in the other. These things go together. There is nothing easy or gentle about the love of the universe or the love of the Divine. It is a fierce place we are part of, a very demanding world. But the question is: does the universe, in a deeper sense, pay attention to our pain? Is there a way in which, by engaging our pain as conscientiously as we can, it leads to our development in the long term? Is the universe listening to us in our pain? I think it is. I think it is an intentional process, even though I can’t answer your question satisfactorily.",

It’s just getting started. We have to imagine ourselves a million years from now—which is nothing in evolutionary time—envisioning the answer to this question: What is the purpose of creation? Why is this happening? A million years from now, we’ll have a much deeper answer to that question, and a million years after that, deeper still. So I caution closure on these questions. I’d rather be agnostic, open-ended. I do think it has to do with self-knowledge and self-expression.

And I want to mention at the outset that some reincarnation thinkers assume every little thing in our lives is determined, but I don’t think we need to go there. Chance is a powerful element of this universe. We can affirm meaning and intentionality without forcing every detail into that press of “What’s the meaning of this? What’s the meaning of that?” We can affirm a larger scope of meaning in a world with chance, variables, and uncertainties. What’s important is understanding that the universe pays attention to how we respond to chance events as well as intentional events. Our learning—our quality of response—is carried forward and does us credit, regardless of the origin of the challenges we face.",

      "text": "experiencing is part of that. For what point—what is the ultimate purpose of all of this happening?\nChris Bache:\nLet me break that down into two parts—the classical vision, first, on reincarnation. In most Eastern traditions, you grow, get clearer, kinder, more generous, cultivate deeper qualities, and eventually reach a spiritual maturing where your consciousness opens to the core of your being. You awaken to the fact that the essence of your nature is the essence of all nature, that all beings share the same nature. There’s an explosion of compassion and a deep embrace of the universe. The usual interpretation is that you are now free to leave time and space—what the Hindus call Moksha—to escape Samsara. It’s an “up and out” cosmology. The religions of the Axial Age, in one way or another, are part of that pattern: we don’t want to be on Earth, we’re in a veil of tears, we want out—by salvation or enlightenment. But that leaves fundamentally unexplained: What is the purpose of the universe? What is the purpose of this magnificent creation? With our deeper understanding of the magnitude of existence—how many billions of years went into the unfolding of the universe—it becomes profoundly unacceptable and short-sighted to think the purpose of life is to awaken to your true nature and then escape into nirvana or an off-planet paradise.",
