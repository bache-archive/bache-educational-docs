In this image, the drop at the center underneath the line represents our egoic, private consciousness. Everything above the line represents spiritual reality. In transpersonal consciousness, the first Death-Rebirth experience takes place at the interface of our time-space consciousness and the beginnings of spiritual consciousness, and it's usually referred to as ego death. It is the complete destruction of our personal time-space identity and the beginning of an opening into spiritual reality.",

When one sits to meditate or do spiritual practice, the first step is cultivating bodhicitta—the wish to save all sentient beings. You do the practice not for personal benefit but to nourish the uplift of the whole of creation. The last step is distributing the merit—you give away the blessings you’ve acquired. In mature spiritual practice, everything is for the benefit of the whole.",

It shows up in the early stages when you're going through powerful kriyas and this tremendous physical and emotional detoxification, which can leave you in convulsions, bouncing around the mattress, as your body throws off vast quantities of physical and emotional stress. There is a certain violence in dying. Over the course of the work, I learned that the deepest breakthroughs followed the deepest purifications, and the deepest deaths yielded the deepest ecstatic joys on the other side. As that became clear, death became my closest ally. Rather than trying to avoid harsh confrontations, I did everything I could to facilitate their emergence. I went right at it—not because I like suffering, but because I like what was on the other side. I came to understand that even death in a psychedelic context is a form of purification: letting go of reality as you know it at one level to gain access to reality at a deeper level. So it became part of the work.",

From a reincarnation perspective, we’re always popping into time-space and popping out into a spiritual meta-universe, then back in and out again. From this perspective, what is death? All the enlightenment and awakening traditions say the same thing: birth is not the beginning of our life. Look carefully and you’ll find in your body and mind evidence of experience that far predates your physical life. Death is not the end, because we now have, especially through the work of people like Michael Newton on life-between-lives and past-life therapy, abundant evidence of a continuity of consciousness that predates and postdates our individual life.",

Once you transition several times into that reality, you know in your bones, from your own experience, that death is not an end of anything. It's simply the end of an incarnational cycle, and there is absolutely nothing to fear about death. Death is homecoming. All of the Hollywood bullshit thrown up at us—dark places and demons and ghosts and all this stuff—it's just nonsense. Ninety-nine percent of people die and make a transition into the light perfectly naturally and comfortably. If you're afraid of dying, you've got your entire metaphysics upside down. Death is homecoming. Death is the end of your matriculation. It's the harvesting of your life. Birth should be mourned. Birth is where the work begins.

The evolutionary drama isn’t ending. This is a new platform within which the story will continue to develop. We’ve been evolving by learning from suffering, our great teacher in much of the past, but we’re getting past that—just as we’re growing out of our fear of death. If there were one thing I wish I could give people from my sessions, it would be to lose the fear of death. If you’re afraid of death, your cosmology is upside down.

When I started, I thought there was just one death—ego death—that would launch you into the spiritual universe. But the spiritual universe has many layers. Being operational at one layer doesn’t mean you’re operational at deeper layers. You go through another metamorphosis—another death and surrender—to be reborn into another layer, and so on. That reflects the Tibetan idea of Bardo: a discrete layer of consciousness. In describing the after-death journey, there are multiple Bardos you pass through—the hungry ghosts, heavenly spirits, and so on. In the West, we often use Bardo to represent the totality of what happens after death, and that’s fine, but the original use points to stages in a progression.",

So what doesn’t die?\n\nChris Bache:\nWhen we go deep, we realize that everything is dying and living, dying and living, constantly. There are no stable things which are not dying in this universe. To see that clearly is considered a great accomplishment—to really understand that everything is temporary, transitional, moving, fluid. People have asked me, “What is it that dies?” What I will say is there is always continuity of memory. If you organize your session well, there is continuity of recall; therefore there is continuity of memory. You might say that memory doesn’t die, but I don’t think that’s the best way to describe it.

Could you elaborate?\nChris Bache: I explore this in a chapter called “The Birth of the Future Human,” and earlier in “The Great Awakening” in Dark Night, Early Dawn (2000). I was uncomfortable entering this territory at first—I’m not drawn to historical speculation. I began this work for individual healing and enlightenment, and that premise was blown away within a few years. The purification, the access to information and knowledge—everything seemed to be in service of the species as a whole. It’s not that our species is special in the universe, but the Divine’s focus here, now, seems species-wide.\n\nThis emphasis repeated so often and strongly that the gist of my 20-year journey became the collective story of death and rebirth. I have deep convictions that we’ve entered the dark night of our collective soul—a period of purification, confronting the sins of our fathers and mothers, which are our own through reincarnation. We’re facing our past choices and their consequences, purifying the toxins they left, to open into new dimensions of our being.",

Maybe not the second time, but with repeated listening it can narrow your experience instead of expanding and opening it.\n\nRyan Kemp\nAs you touched on, what you came to learn was a series of iterated deaths and rebirths in one body, which appears in Stan Grof’s work as well. Could you talk about how you view that—and its relationship to actual death and rebirth as we know it, the leaving of this form and coming back into a new form?\n\nChris Bache\nIt took me a long time to understand the patterns of my sessions. In some ways they started as I expected, drawing upon Stan’s map of consciousness, but after a few years they seemed to diverge and enter new territory. One thing I’ve come to understand is that consciousness has many levels—operational tiers. Each time you enter a new level, there is required a surrender of everything you had known and assumed before, in order to enter a level that operates by completely different rules.",

It always involves surrender to the unknown and yielding to the fear that’s holding your system locked in place. At advanced stages I truly did fear for my sanity, or at least I knew I was going someplace completely beyond anything I could hold on to. I couldn’t hold on to sanity as I had known it. It was like going over a waterfall. But once you go over and experience that death, you wake up in a new reality as a new kind of being—not just a new-and-improved you, but a different kind of being—where, for hours at a time, you can experience the universe as it experiences itself, completely beyond any human frame of reference.",

This is one of the great gifts that Stan Grof gave me—reading his work, I learned to trust the process. If you submit to it—let it take you where it will—no matter how terrible it becomes, no matter how inscrutable, if you surrender to it, it will always culminate. It will take you through a breaking point, and then it will catch you. You die, and then you awaken into a different condition, a different reality, as a different being in a different dimension of existence.\n\nIain McNay:\nSo what do you mean that you will die—what does that actually mean in a tangible way?\n\nChris Bache:\nIn order to experience intimately the deep nature of reality, you can't take your ego into that reality and have a transpersonal experience. The only way to enter these realities is to become a “citizen” of those realities. Our time-space identity—just by the conditioning of time and space—keeps us small. In order to enter vast expanses of reality, we have to let go of what keeps us small. So you go through a psychological death—ego death is very common.",

It’s a beautiful vision.\nChris Bache:\nEvery time we die, at the deepest level all spiritual traditions tell us no one dies—we transition into a different level of reality. I’m not making light of death or trivializing it, only affirming this deeper insight: everything we are survives the death of the body. At the end of every lifetime, we return to where we came from as a resting place. We are restored and refreshed, and then we return to the challenges of history. We don’t have to live through all the evolutionary future to know freedom from the fear of death. If there were one thing from my psychedelic experiences I wish I could give the world, it would be eliminating the fear of death. I am not only unafraid of dying—I’m looking forward to it, because death is homecoming. Always, death is homecoming.\n\nSimeon Mihaylov:\nDifferent spiritual traditions have said that in different ways. Carl Jung says at one point that life is a short period between two infinities—which, in the end, might just be one. I think that’s a beautiful way of putting it.",

      "text": "ain and suffering to reach deeper levels of consciousness. Can you share what that was like for you?\nChris Bache: In the early stage at the level of personal mind, the pain and suffering took the form Stan Grof discusses as the perinatal level—sometimes reliving birth and confronting the fundamental existential questions of life in physical reality. Is there meaning, order, design, intelligence? At the physical level, everything we love will be destroyed at death. Is there any reality beyond death? You have to face the deepest levels of metaphysical angst until your identity is crushed and shattered. That’s easier for some than others, but you must surrender your time-space identity to gain access to the next level. At that next level, I continued a deepening confrontation with pain, suffering, and violence—so deep and prolonged, encompassing so many hundreds of thousands of persons over thousands of years, that I concluded it wasn’t a cleansing of my personal psyche. Something was using my sessions to set in motion a reconciliation and healing of levels of pain that were fundamentally collective. Then further deaths and rebirths followed, where the nature of death and suffering changes the deeper you go. The basic principle is simple: if you want to experience oneness with God or the mind of the universe, our historical consciousness is too small—if you want to literally experience it, not just think it. To immerse yourself in communion with these levels, your small identity must be surrendered and you must flow into a larger identity. Eventually you enter levels where it would misrepresent things to say “Chris Bache went and had those experiences.” Rather, Chris Bache has to be destroyed, dissolved, for these levels of consciousness to manifest inside my awareness. The fact that I remember them doesn’t mean my personality was present when they were had. You lose yourself, enter communion with the universe, and when you come back you gather the experiences, and my personality synthesizes and integrates them. It’s a pulsing: surrender completely, open, breathe, receive teachings, then bring it back in and consolidate.",

That makes some people in the therapeutic community uncomfortable. But once you learn that deep purification—the deep confrontation with limits at any level—leads to ecstatic deliverance from those limits at another level, then it's the most natural thing in the world. It's quite natural for us to die. Nobody survives the game of life. We live in a culture that's uncomfortable engaging content around death because we don't understand what death is. We're chronically constricted within time-space realities. We don't understand what happens when we die or the liberation death involves. It's not just psychedelics that show us this. Near-death research shows us this; hypnotic regression past-life therapy shows us this; Michael Newton’s work shows us this. Once you understand the larger circle—that life is a circle; that there is birth, a deep internalization of circumstances and challenges and learning; and then death, which is a phase of homecoming, returning to the light—what's to be afraid of? Dying is graduation. Birth is when the hard work begins. That's what you should be afraid of.",
