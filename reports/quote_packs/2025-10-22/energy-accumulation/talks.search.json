      "text": "re”—that kind of thing, which I listen to, remember, and try to emulate. But keep it up, keep it up.\nChris Bache:\nLet me mention something about the etheric field. This comes at the very end of \"The Living Classroom.\" The book was published in 2008, written in 2006–2007, and I stopped the heavy-duty psychedelic work in '99. Over time, this energetic resonance calmed down; it didn't go away entirely, but instead of being like a lightning rod, where things happened around me without my effort, I had to cooperate with it—I had to let it happen. Not that I could control it, but there was a sense that it was subtler. That teaches us something about the etheric level: the practice empowers the system, you open up, you bring in heavy-duty energy, you move from 110 volts to 240 volts—naturally, you activate these inherent circuits. But then if things calm down, it’s not like the circuits go away—the network is there, but there’s less energy driving it. There's wisdom in the pace of evolution. There is a certain—not a risk, exactly, but if you drive the system hard, things happen; then you calm down and things settle. So I don’t have that transparency today that I did at the peak described in \"The Living Classroom.\" Now it’s much subtler than it was then.",

The principle of accumulation is fundamental to understanding what’s happening in creation. The universe is accumulating—it’s learning. It’s a self-learning system. We are constantly learning; we can’t help but learn. Even if we do a mediocre job in a lifetime, we’re still learning. As we learn, we activate capacities. In one sense, I think we’re learning to be geniuses in every area of life: a genius at chess, a genius at relationships—genius in all the different areas. Each lifetime is a petal in a flower; the soul is the flower. I sometimes meditate on a flower and imagine each hundred-year lifetime as a pistil, a stamen, a petal in this magnificent flower. To be a genius at life—to be completely unfolded and take advantage of the opportunity we’ve been given to grow and become more than we’ve been.",

The way the speeding-up process worked itself out in my sessions had to do with understanding the field dynamics of consciousness. I have just enough understanding of chaos theory and non-equilibrium systems to grasp that when a system has more and more energy poured into it, it reaches a state far from equilibrium. In that condition—like water as you keep increasing the energy going into it, or a bathtub as you keep increasing the quantity of water and the ripples start to change—we come to a tipping point, a bifurcation point, where the system has too much energy to maintain its current structures. It flips into a different organizational pattern. It chooses a different future. When physical systems reach non-equilibrium points, they can do extraordinary things: produce new particles, create orders of coherence within themselves that would have been impossible at a lower energy state.",

When you go into these states, you open into vast fields of consciousness, and the energy is just immense—it runs through your system. You have to prepare your body to go into those states, and after the session, you have to help it absorb the experience in a healthy manner. You have to stay clean—in your habits, in your meditation, your yoga, structural aspects of your body. I discovered that my system had a natural capacity to let go, and I never had trouble coming back—there was a natural congealing. But you have to monitor your system carefully. I would have a session, write it up, then take two or three months to absorb it, ponder it, follow its teachings—because it gives you teachings. Then I would open up again, and the process would repeat itself.\n\nIain McNay:\nThere are also layers of conditioning you're letting go of—not by effort, but by allowance in the sessions, yes?",

I still use medicines from time to time, though much less than I used to. It’s somewhat a young person’s game. I’m 70 now—if I haven’t learned by now… After I stopped the LSD work in ’99, I occasionally did light sessions, or psilocybin sessions, and a few ayahuasca sessions, or salvia divinorum. I broadened my experience with those substances. But the LSD work was in a category unto itself.\n\nOne thing I found was that my body, my system, was storing energy over time. Doing multiple sessions, my system stored energy and used it periodically to trigger breakthroughs into new levels of consciousness. Even if I took a massive dose of LSD today, I wouldn’t get back to where I was working regularly when I finished in ’99. It would take years to develop the power to access those deeper dimensions. Over time I understood that every step into a deeper level of consciousness is a step into a higher energetic state.\n\nJef Baker:\nThat line really stood out.\n\nChris Bache:\nIt takes a long time to develop the power to access these highly energized states of consciousness.",

I stopped for two reasons. I stopped first because my physical system—my subtle energy system, my prana or qi—was running so hot after all these years of practice that it was producing certain physical symptoms that left me continually uncomfortable. I describe these in the book, but basically I understood enough about chronic energy and Ayurvedic medicine to understand what was happening, and I was just running too much energy. But that's not the major reason I stopped. The major reason I stopped was heartache.

But the core truth manifesting there—without mentioning psychedelics—is that consciousness is unified from the start. Everything we do in our individual field radiates 360 degrees. All of our spiritual practice, all of our actions, radiate and touch the consciousness of the beings around us. Knowing this, we take more responsibility for sending a positive, beneficial experience into the world. We are never isolated from those around us. It may be invisible or subtle, but it’s always there. The more we act on that basis, the more we activate the sinews that bind us to life. This is true not just for human beings—it’s true for all life forms that surround us. That’s the core teaching of The Living Classroom: there’s an atomistic quality to teaching, and a quantum quality. You and I have been having, in some ways, an atomistic conversation, but we can trust that there’s a quantum quality to it.",

Why was all that physical and energetic purification necessary?\nChris Bache\nThere are many levels of answers, but basically, if we want deeper intimacy with the consciousness of the universe, we’re moving into states that are vast and operate at a much higher frequency and energy level. Our egoic consciousness—the ordinary consciousness organized around our bodily existence—is too small. We have to let go of that consciousness. Some people find that easier or more difficult, but letting go at the egoic level and entering into spiritual reality is the first of many cycles of death and rebirth, because the universe has many levels and dimensions. To enter each successive deeper level, we have to go through a deeper surrender, and that often involves intense purification and confrontation.\n\nEvery step deeper into the universe is a step into a higher bandwidth of energy. We have to literally become a being who can live at that level—be operational at that level—for hours at a time. That takes work. It takes a lot of work.",

I think it will take me many lifetimes to fully integrate all the gifts I’ve been given.\n\nSandy Sedgbeer:\nWhat do you think, in light of what you’ve told us—what you’ve learned and seen—we most urgently need to address now as a species?\n\nChris Bache:\nThere are many layers to that question.

We're coming into a time when, decade by decade, things are going to be getting worse and worse. There will be tremendous social anxiety and personal anxiety as we basically inherit the consequences of our abuse of the Earth for all the hundreds of years that we've been creating this extractive economy. But I hope, in everybody's own individual spiritual practices, one encounters enough of the universe to experience the profound wisdom—the great intelligence—that's behind this moment of transformation, and the great compassion and love that's behind this time in our history. We are not victims. This is not an accident. It is a time that calls for us to become the heroes that we have the possibility of being—nothing less than deep, deep heroic sacrifice and actualization is called for. But the universe will support us. Every time we make a change to live to the larger good, the universe will support us. It will help us overcome our shortcomings. This is the game of life. This is the great time of our life.

First, I think integration is very important. We have the chemical technology to trigger very deep states of consciousness, but these states may have very little lasting impact on our deeply ingrained psychological and cultural habits if we don't take time to sit with them and integrate them as deeply as we can into our embodied existence.\n\nOver the course of my work, even though I was paying a lot of attention and doing as good a job as I could to integrate each individual session, I still underestimated the long-term challenges of integrating an entire spiritual journey. I didn't fully comprehend this until I had stopped my journey and realized how hard the stopping hit me, exposing the imbalance—the failure to integrate the most extreme, radical experiences, which were the deepest: being drawn into intimacy, into communion with—I want to say the divine, but I'm cautious because we have to unpack theological baggage.",

Chris?\nChris Bache: Dan, I would underscore everything you just said and put my initials beside it, because I believe it. One of the things that was shown to me along the way—when you talked about fields and quantum fields—was that the intensity of the global crisis we're entering is going to hyper-stimulate not only our individual fields but the collective field of humanity. It will drive us into non-linear conditions. We know something about how physical fields behave in non-linear conditions—chaos theory. If we assume the psychic field of humanity under non-linear, far-from-equilibrium conditions will have some of those same qualities, then we have a way of seeing emergence from the depths of the human psyche: the emergence of new forms, crystallizations that weren’t available previously but actualize latent capacities within human nature. That feels deeply aligned with what you’re talking about, and it helps us understand how we can make as big a change as we need to in as short a time as we have. When we come to trigger points—bifurcations—systems are very susceptible to small perturbations, so the influence of individuals increases the more we move into a period of crisis. That gives added weight to each of our effects on the outcome. I really support what you’re saying.",
