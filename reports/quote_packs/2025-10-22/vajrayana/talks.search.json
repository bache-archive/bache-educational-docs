It seems like you found a home in Vajrayana Buddhism—is that right?\n\nChris Bache:\nIt is, and it’s a kind of modified Vajrayana. I did intense Vajrayana practice for a number of years, and I’ve modified it from my psychedelic experiences. It’s not that I’ve realized those states, but I have an understanding and experiential memory of those levels of reality. They live inside me as active memories. I’ve developed forms of Vajrayana practice by integrating those memories into the realization protocols.",

By becoming temporarily more aware, I could feel more precisely how these practices affect body and mind. They also helped me manage challenges. I didn’t end up doing this work for the purpose of spiritual awakening—though that was always in the background—but as a philosopher hungry to explore the nature of reality. Vajrayana helped me manage the excess energy flowing through my body by giving it an intermediate place to live and breathe—between my physical existence and my psychedelic existence. It taught me these practices are much more powerful than I’d appreciated working from ordinary time-space consciousness.",

I was more interested in the Zen tradition. I wasn’t interested in all the bells, candles, incense, and fanfare that comes with Vajrayana. But she went there, and I followed her. Through her, I met teachers gathering at the Tara Mandala Buddhist retreat center—Lama sutra malayonis established the center in Colorado—and I began to study there and go into retreats with that lineage. I met their lineage of awakened beings, and they made a deep impression on me. If my karma had introduced me to the great awakened beings of the Zen lineage, I could have gone there just as easily. It was the opportunity to meet these beings and receive teachings that made a large impression.\n\nTasshin Fogleman:\nComing back to your explorations, you use the phrase “deep time.” Can you say what you mean by that?",

I’d always been a meditator, but I began a more formal relationship with Vajrayana teachers and practice. This helped where I was working—very pure, intense states of awareness, Diamond Luminosity. It was increasingly difficult for my subtle energy system to sustain encounters with the enormous flows of pure energy in this diamond consciousness. When I began doing ancient practices—ChÃ¶d and various deity practices—I found my physical, psychological, and subtle energy systems could breathe more freely. Vajrayana gave me a space midway between physical consciousness and psychedelic consciousness. By entering those states, I could channel the energy that came in my psychedelic sessions; it moved more freely. It gave me a way of dialoguing with the universe that allowed my body and mind to breathe more comfortably. It was very helpful.",

What does your daily practice look like, or what would you recommend?\n\nChris Bache:\nThe longer I worked with psychedelics, the more I appreciated the importance of a daily spiritual practice. Conscientious psychedelic work opens your system to a vast field of consciousness—deeper, larger—and to enormous flows of energy. Each step into deeper consciousness is a step into higher energy. To stabilize at that level, you have to acclimate to that energy, which requires intense purification processes—often like fire, solar flares, volcanic energy—transforming your being so you can live for hours at a time at very deep levels where the world works differently, where causal-level reality is a different physics, a different landscape of consciousness.",

      "text": "ime, which I recall you relating to bhakti—loving devotion, alleviating the suffering of all beings?\nChris Bache: Yin and yang is an attempt by a particular culture to articulate some of the deep structure of the universe and to point to this primal duality, which then divides into the 10,000 things—the complexity of the evolving of life. But I think we have to be careful not to hang too much on the primary polarity—good/bad, male/female, things like this. Bhakti is a different issue, and this was a surprise to me. In Hinduism there are four systems of spiritual work—four yogas: jnana yoga, the yoga of meditation; karma yoga, the yoga of action; and bhakti, the yoga of emotion. It’s loving God—it’s becoming awakened through love. I had always been attracted to the mental forms of spiritual practice. Of all the yogas in Hinduism, I was least attracted to bhakti—the cultivation of an emotional relationship with the divine—yet I found in the psychedelic work that bhakti was activated, very powerfully activated. I had not only a mental relationship with the universe and a cognitive experience of the universe, but an overwhelmingly powerful emotional connection and experience so that it became a love relationship. Everybody has to develop their own vocabulary for ultimate reality, but my vocabulary for ultimate reality—I call the Absolute “my Beloved,” “the Beloved,” because that’s the bhakti quality.",

Creation is intentional. I hesitate to use “design,” but there is an intelligence manifesting in time and space. We are part of this intelligence; our nature is of the same nature as its nature—Atman is Brahman. Reincarnation is a fact of life. We won’t get far trying to understand existence unless we understand the pulse of life—that our current life is just the most recent in many cycles of life and death. There is an underlying logic to our circumstances—what Buddhists and Hindus call karma—an intentionality working itself out in our lives. Our evolution is not driven solely by blind chance and mechanical processes; there is a deeper intelligence manifesting in our circumstances and challenges, inviting us to become more by the end of life than we were at the beginning.

All honor to the great masters who've done this through the power of their own daily practice—they were always my teachers and masters. What they describe and what I experienced seem to fit hand in glove; there's nothing new there. The only difference is the method—someone with modest spiritual capacity, if they have enough determination and courage to submit to the regimen, might have a temporary experience of these things. As Huston Smith said, “A mystical experience does not a mystic make”—you can’t use these experiences to maintain that consciousness permanently. It would be nice if you could, but by going back and forth, and doing the daily practices, hopefully more and more of it internalizes in your being and you grow.",

The first two times, I was taken deeper into it and had the encounter with what I call the absolute light, which showed me it’s an infinite progression. The next two times, the diamond luminosity began to crunch itself deeper into my physical being. I wasn’t going out; it was coming in—into my psyche and body. It felt like it was changing me at a cellular level. By the very end of my journey, my perception had changed—how I literally see things. Not permanently, but it gave me a temporary experience I call diamond vision. I was seeing a hundred, a thousand times more sharply and clearly than ever before. I realized I was seeing through the eyes of the future human—seeing in a way all humanity will one day see. All our senses—sight, touch, taste—are being elevated to higher levels the more consciousness we can internalize in our bodies.",

When one sits to meditate or do spiritual practice, the first step is cultivating bodhicitta—the wish to save all sentient beings. You do the practice not for personal benefit but to nourish the uplift of the whole of creation. The last step is distributing the merit—you give away the blessings you’ve acquired.

But even the Eastern models I knew didn’t encapsulate the full scale of what opened in this journey. Yes, you can work through multiple layers of the bardo, the after-death states; you can go into extra-samsaric reality, spiritual dimensions beyond the bardo. But Buddhism, which was the tradition I was most at home with, tends to stop there and invoke the grand silence—when the Buddha was asked ultimate questions, he remained silent. I found realities opening at that dimension that were beyond that.\n\nJef Baker:\nGrand silence is often correlated with ineffability, a word thrown around in the psychedelic world, especially with large doses.

Here’s one: how does your process relate to Christology? Did you have Christ avatar experiences, and how does that map onto your journey?\n\nChris Bache:\nInteresting question. Two traditions have had the largest influence on my life—Christianity and Buddhism. I also taught world religions for decades, and the lineages became passionate lovers for me; each taught me so much. While I started within a Christian framework, I came to see that Christ is the fruition of a spiritual impulse in the Middle East that parallels, in seminal ways, the fruition of similar impulses in India, Africa, South America.

First, the mechanics. Second, the meaning. Third—and most important—the transmission of lung, the seed energy of the practice. You receive a seed from a teacher who has matured the practice in their being, and you water and nourish it in yours.\n\nThat’s my context for transmission, and it applies in my psychedelic context. I was put through enormous purification to receive teachings from those levels of consciousness. If there’s a parallel between the cushion and the psychedelic session—and if we’re in a historical shift—then my intuition is that we’re experiencing a rise in divine influx. There’s more energy coming up underneath us, more information becoming available—not just physically via the internet, but from the center of our being. Teachings and insights are rising inside us, which we can catch, but to catch them we must prepare ourselves. We have to empty ourselves of what is small to receive pieces of what is large.
