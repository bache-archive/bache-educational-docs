I entered a reality that was more real than physical reality—like Plato’s cave, where someone escapes the cave and enters a world more real than the physical, which is disorienting at first. When I entered archetypal reality, I stayed there in my sessions for the next year and a half. I went through a death deeper than ego death: I had to cease to be a human being in any way, shape, or form. My consciousness could no longer operate within the confines of even our collective psyche. I entered a state of awareness beyond the collective psyche, and at that level I was being worked with, taught how reality functions.",

Jung talked about archetypes as primary themes of human experience that become concretized in forms—wise old man, wise old woman, trickster, shadow—the dominant themes of the collective psyche. The second sense is Platonic: Plato’s discovery of a level of reality beyond time and space altogether.\n\nI experienced both, though not as Plato described them. He thought of archetypes as unchanging prototypes within the mind of an unchanging, infinite being. I experienced them as living entities—but living on a vast scale of time and space far beyond anything we know within time and space. What is shared is that for something to manifest in time and space, it comes out of the oneness through these fundamental intermediate structures—super-intelligent, super-powerful—focusing energy down into manifestation.",

They were vast, enormous, like galaxies billions of light years across. They were archetypes, not static ideas in the mind of an unchanging god, but living forms evolving over vast tracts of time. At the lower subtle, more Jungian level, I entered into the living tissue of the collective psyche. I had experiences of the wholeness that the human psyche and even the human body represents—how we’re all fractal manifestations of a larger pattern, and how each of us, by healing our personal diseases, contributes to the collective, archetypal human body becoming stronger through history.",

But the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic states is echoed in the work of other psychedelicists—if they’re using a method and substance with sufficient power to break through the same number of layers.

I was shown how the individual is hardwired and soft-wired into this matrix, how the species mind informs our individual consciousness, and how our individual work reaches out to inform and structure future species consciousness. I saw that each of us carries a holographic, fractal piece of the diseases of our time—mental and physical—and as we heal ourselves, we contribute to healing the collective psyche. In that sense, you could say the collective psyche is more real than the individual psyche, though I’d put it differently: the individual is real; the collective is real. They operate on different scales and are mutually implicated. And both are transcended by Platonic, archetypal levels radically beyond our human collective psyche.",

Sometimes, however, we meet deities that are not part of our lineage and perhaps not even in our awareness. They can appear completely out of left field, yet take the recognizable cultural form of a deity—Ganesh, Jesus, Mary, the Prophet Muhammad, and others.",

In Jung’s model, when we go below our conscious mind, we first encounter our personal unconscious. If you go deeper, you enter a stream of awareness shared by all human beings of your species—Jung’s collective psyche. Deeper still, you can enter broader streams—what some would call global consciousness—and then levels that go beyond space-time altogether: archetypal levels, complete states of dissolving into non-duality and what might be called causal oneness, and deeper states even than that. It’s a long journey with many levels of exploration along the way.\n\nRyan Kemp\nSo, as in Jung and in many spiritual and religious texts, we have our personal, individual mind, but the universe itself is a mind, a oneness of its own.

When I entered into archetypal reality and died as a human being—died to my species identity—my sessions took me outside the operational range of our collective psyche, beyond human experience and history. Moving beyond the collective psyche, everything associated with it fell away: our understandings and projections of God, the flotsam and jetsam of history. I moved into increasingly clear, contentless states of consciousness that are hard to describe. We should be careful with language: “universal mind” or “cosmic mind” are huge concepts. The only part of that mind I know is what it taught me. There was a consciousness that took me in, taught me, ground me up into dust, and took me deeper into itself. Even so, I was experiencing aspects—fractal manifestations—of its totality. My language peters out at that depth. In Diamond Luminosity, I had a clear perception of moving outside Samsara, outside the Bardo, into a reality even beyond archetypal reality. There was a period of being born into archetypal reality, and then a process of being born out of it into a level that pre-exists archetypal reality—absolutely non-physical.",

First, I had to let go of framing my work as personal journey—personal transformation, personal healing, personal awakening—and get involved in a much larger dance with the species mind and the collective unconscious, then be catapulted into archetypal reality and deeper, causal levels.\n\nWhat I'm about to say about where we are historically will sound outrageous and highly speculative, but when you work very deeply—far underneath the personal psyche, dropping into the collective psyche and into the creative intent underlying the evolution of our species—these things come into focus in ways that make sense from a quantum or post-Newtonian paradigm.",

Would you like to say more?\nChris Bache:\nMy first concern was that it sounded like ego gone amok—ego inflation. I had to sit with that a long time, because my experiences told me that’s not what was happening. As you said, it’s a very different worldview. In the classic individual patient model, the individual is having experiences. The individual has transpersonal experiences, and the individual is always at the center. In this model, my individual existence was completely secondary. It becomes not a matter of my being central. I got the system started, but I dissolved completely into preexisting fields of consciousness. Those fields are the dynamic force having the experiences.\n\nThat manifested not only in the ocean of suffering, but later in archetypal reality and causal oneness. In many experiences, Chris Bache was a bit player. In the book I have an appendix: what dies and is reborn? After so many deaths and rebirths, it becomes a cognitive question. What is actually dying? It feels personal. Is it just ego dying over and over?",

When I looked for correlations in spiritual traditions, in Buddhism I think this is what they call Dharmakaya—the clear light of absolute reality out of which existence springs.

We have a deep, visceral identity that’s deeper than our individual egoic identity, and to die as a human being is deeper than to die as an individual human being. To go into archetypal reality, I had to cease functioning cognitively in human terms and acclimate to flows of reality profoundly beyond not only my individual existence but beyond human existence. I moved outside the human field to levels of archetypal reality: a high, Platonic level—something like what Plato points to, except Plato’s archetypes are eternal forms in the mind of an unchanging God, and I experienced them as vast, living beings, overwhelmingly beyond my capacity to comprehend; I could touch pieces, but they were far too large. At a lower subtle level, I entered deep into the collective unconscious of humanity—the species mind—experiencing the human species as a single being, with networks of intelligence weaving our individual efforts, minds, and karma into larger patterns by which the species as a whole lives and breathes. I think I was being given a crash course in how our species works as a single organism to prepare for what came next.",

Depth is different: entering contact with deeper levels of reality—other systems, other beings, archetypal realities, the void, the pure cosmic void. Different categories of experience.\n\nJef Baker:\nThat might be a good point to talk about archetypes.\n\nChris Bache:\nWhen I got to the end of the journey, I looked back and asked how many fundamental platforms of consciousness I had entered. I boiled them down to five: work at the personal level; work at the collective mind—where the ocean of suffering arose and purification aimed at the collective more than the personal; then the archetypal dimension; then oneness or causal consciousness; and finally what I call the diamond luminosity—what Buddhism calls Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality.",

      "text": "gs. You said these beings live through humanity, experience through humanity, love through humanity.\nChris Bache:\nI’ve had reservations about that particular line, but I kept it in because it’s in my original notes. When the ocean of suffering culminated, it exploded me into a deeper level of consciousness. The distinctive qualities were twofold: it was incredibly ancient—beyond anything I’d imagined—and more real than time and space. I eventually came to understand it as archetypal reality: a level that exists before time and space and contributes fundamental structures to them. The vision is that all reality emerges out of a primal One which starts as a void and manifests as the Big Bang. Between the One and even the Big Bang, there are many gradations—unfoldings of the Divine, though I hesitate to use that word because of its connotations. There are many layers, and lower levels are sourced in the actions of higher levels. I was encountering these—whether to call them beings or principles—vast entities others have experienced too. The best my mind could do to give them form was to see them as galaxies—images borrowed from Hubble and James Webb—though they weren’t galaxies, just that massive in scale. These beings were part of creation, creating time and space and some of the structures within it. Far down the line we have human beings. The insight was that all human existence—and, in fact, all existence—was an expression of the intentions of these deeper cosmological principles and beings. I’m not sure I got all the pieces lined up, but I do think all human experience, male and female, is an aspect of a species intelligence; that species intelligence is an aspect of a planetary intelligence, which is an aspect of a solar-system and galactic intelligence. These deeper intelligences manifest as our lives; they experience the world as we do, experiencing the adventures we are having.",

Is that a fair representation?\nChris Bache\nIt is, and that description fits better in the early stages, when you’re working at insights that help you understand your individual way of being in the world. I describe my work fundamentally as cosmological exploration—where not only do you leave your individual ego behind (at least temporarily), but you leave deeper and deeper levels behind and are given the opportunity to explore how the universe constructs its reality: how archetypal reality structures time-and-space reality, how oneness manifests in the diversity of all physical life forms—down to atomic, nuclear, quantum levels—how the pure void of emptiness is that mysterious, fertile essence giving birth to time and space, moment by moment. It is useful to understand your personal ways of contracting and sustaining your smallness, but for me—trained as a philosopher—I wanted to understand the larger spectrum of reality. The invitation I was given was to explore how time and space are made. I often wished I had a PhD in physics or astrophysics—I could have understood so much more of what I was being shown.

How can that be, that an individual awakes yet another does not?\nChris Bache:\nThe metaphor I like to use when teaching my students is that of leaves and the tree. Imagine leaves being individually conscious, yet they are manifestations of the consciousness of the tree. So we are individually conscious, and there is a narrative of individual evolution, but if you really dig deep and ask “what is an individual?” then you encounter the collective psyche—the consciousness of the planet, the galaxy, and then deeper, as you say, the absolute, what I call my belovedness. Individual awakening is a mistaken inference. It’s true that if you don’t work individually, you make no progress, but when you do, you're actually drawing many people's consciousness into your work. So it’s impossible to put a boundary on awakening; the universe doesn't even think in terms of individuals—it's interested in awakening the entire species. Not this religion, that continent, but the whole human family into evolutionary progression.

There I experienced all of humanity repeatedly as a single organism and was given many lessons over the next year: each of our minds is like a fractal spark within a species mind; each of our bodies a cell within an integrated body of humanity. There is a continuous feedback system—flow from the whole of humanity into each of us, and the choices we make flowing back into the collective—very similar to Rupert Sheldrake’s morphic fields theory.",
