      "text": "Luminosity refer to actual diamonds?” Another viewer asks whether it’s related to the Diamond Sutra.\nChris Bache:\nThat’s not a silly question at all. A bit of background: “Diamond Luminosity” points to states of consciousness I entered in the last five years of my work. I had already gone through what Stan Grof calls the perinatal process and a really solid ego death. I had entered what I later called the ocean of suffering at the collective psyche level, gone into archetypal reality, causal-level reality—many adventures—and I felt philosophically satiated and complete. I was experiencing profound oneness with existence, touching the meta-cosmic void, standing under the waterfall of cosmic love. I was existentially very satisfied.",

The Diamond Luminosity I experienced is, I believe, a level of reality in the cosmos. In Buddhist terminology, I’d describe it as an extra-samsaric reality—beyond cyclic existence, beyond the Bardo. There are many layers of the Bardo—the low animal hell realms, the high deity realms—but the Diamond Luminosity is beyond all of those. There is a clear phenomenological difference between the high deity realms and then moving into the Diamond Luminosity, which is beyond all deities, archetypes, or any dimension we normally encounter.",

Let me back up. We experience light many times in psychedelic journeys. It’s common: going through ego death, entering light; entering collective dimensions, experiencing dimensions of light. I had known light many times. “Diamond Luminosity” is not just a fancy metaphor. I learned there are many degrees and dimensions of light, and the Diamond Luminosity is an exceptionally pure, exceptionally clear dimension of light. I think the diamond soul, as an assay light being, is a manifestation of this quality of light inside individuated existence. So on the one hand it’s the same, and on the other it’s a variation.

It was an overwhelming, absorbing experience of fundamental oneness. My boundaries dissolved completely—not only personal boundaries. From this perspective, there were no boundaries anywhere in the universe; we are all aspects of this fundamental oneness. I experienced what the Buddhists call shunyata—emptiness, transparency. In another session I was taken into the cosmic, fertile void out of which the universe emerged, an experience of overwhelming cosmic love.

My visual field pivoted, and in the distance, I perceived a reality as far beyond where I was as my current state was beyond Earth, time, and space.

Every time you go through death-rebirth, people often encounter light in many forms. I had encountered it at many levels. After ego-death, after the ocean of suffering, after archetypal and causal realities—about 15 years in—I had been given so many spiritual treasures that I felt existentially satisfied. I had experienced radical Shunyata—emptiness of self—oneness of all existence. Then I went through yet another death-rebirth cycle and accessed a dimension of light so pure and clear it stunned me. It became my sole objective to return.\n\nOnce you touch what I’m calling the diamond Luminosity, it’s so far beyond anything I’d previously touched that I lost interest in archetypal or causal realities. I wanted to get back there. It is breathtakingly pure, and the associated ecstasy is staggering. Over the next five years—26 sessions, one-third of my entire journey—I accessed it only four more times. Between those sessions were deep purification, more learning, more teaching.",

It is the pure light from which the universe arises and returns. It is Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality. In between these four immersions, there were many intense episodes of cleansing and personal healing. In general, there were two movements during this four-year period: first, going deeper into Diamond Luminosity; then Diamond Luminosity began to crunch itself more deeply into my physical body. The turning point for this was Session 50. I only began to understand what was happening after the fact. I had no control over what was happening in the sessions; I went along with wherever the universe was taking me and only figured out afterward what had taken place. In Session 50, I was as deep into the universe as I ever went. I was in the clearest, most sublime state of Diamond Luminosity I had ever known. Then everything in my visual field pivoted 90 degrees, and I saw a reality far into the distance that looked like luminous galaxies. A ray of light from that reality hit me, and it absolutely shattered me. I call it the absolute light, just to give it a name. What it showed me is that the universe we explore in these deep states of consciousness is endless. I would never get to the end of the divine mind, the cosmic mind, even using this powerful method of exploration.",

Tremendous work had been done earlier in the session, and I was in a state where I was integrating streams of consciousness from multiple lifetimes. It was like wrapping string around a kite spool—filaments of white light. They hit a critical mass and fused—these lives fused into a single energy entity. When they fused, there was an explosion of diamond light from my chest that catapulted me into a completely different state of consciousness. I was still an individual, but beyond any frame of reference I had known. I wasn’t Chris Bache; I was a being of which Chris Bache was a part, along with these other former lives.

On a specific note: why the word “diamond” for those realms?\nChris Bache: Having experienced the light itself, “diamond” felt like the most natural image. Perhaps I’m influenced by Vajrayana—the Diamond Way—in the background. The image isn’t uncommon in terma texts that try to describe subtle levels of consciousness, so it came organically from the experience.\n\nOn integration, I’m glad it’s getting more attention. We can blow through levels and have extraordinary experiences with increasing predictability, but internalizing them—really digesting them so they become part of your being—is a long process. I think we overemphasize the dying of seeing and underemphasize the dying of keeping.",

      "text": "diamond luminosity was crunching itself deeper into my mind, personality, physiology, biochemistry.\nIn the 50th session, a particular experience in diamond luminosity radically changed my understanding of existence. I’d pushed hard, thinking the purpose was to reach a final condition—to get home, to become one with the universe or the metacosmic void. I’d had many experiences of oneness and learned there are degrees of oneness; I’d experienced the primal void and learned there are degrees of the void. At the peak of diamond luminosity, resting intact in a deeply blissful state, my visual field pivoted 90 degrees. A circle opened, and in the far distance I saw a reality far beyond diamond luminosity—a domain of light. A ray of light came from that reality and hit me; it shattered me. It took minutes to recover. That’s when I understood it’s an infinite progression. We’ll never get to the end of it. Even with this aggressive mode of exploration, I’d never reach the end. The mind of the universe is too vast. There is a homecoming, yes, but the idea of an end that changes everything—I don’t think so. Oneness is beautiful and important, but even oneness does not exhaust what the universe has to teach.",
