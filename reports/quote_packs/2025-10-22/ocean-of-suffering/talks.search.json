It took me about two and a half years to go through what Stan Grof calls the perinatal dimension of consciousness—very intense physical and emotional purifications, which eventually ended in ego death, being shattered, my entire physical identity turned inside out. Then the ocean of suffering began. At first I thought it was a deeper form of personal suffering, a deeper form of ego death. Eventually—and this is why I wrote Dark Night, Early Dawn at core, to solve the riddle of why the suffering got as large as it did—I concluded it wasn’t aimed at my personal transformation at all. It was aimed at healing the human species.",

In my experience, when I’ve been drawn into a larger overview and encountered the intelligence behind this process, I find myself trusting beyond what I can understand. I trust because of the quality of the being I encounter behind these circumstances. I can’t understand all the pain behind all this. I can come up with any number of partial and incomplete theories for how it works, but in the end we’re brought to our knees trying to grasp it intellectually. If you experience the love and wisdom of the universe, it gives confidence that there truly is a logic to it. And I want to say: the universe is a hard taskmaster. Look at images of Kali the destroyer—she brings death and destruction in one hand and enlightenment in the other. These things go together. There is nothing easy or gentle about the love of the universe or the love of the Divine. It is a fierce place we are part of, a very demanding world. But the question is: does the universe, in a deeper sense, pay attention to our pain? Is there a way in which, by engaging our pain as conscientiously as we can, it leads to our development in the long term? Is the universe listening to us in our pain? I think it is. I think it is an intentional process, even though I can’t answer your question satisfactorily.",

      "text": "ain and suffering to reach deeper levels of consciousness. Can you share what that was like for you?\nChris Bache: In the early stage at the level of personal mind, the pain and suffering took the form Stan Grof discusses as the perinatal level—sometimes reliving birth and confronting the fundamental existential questions of life in physical reality. Is there meaning, order, design, intelligence? At the physical level, everything we love will be destroyed at death. Is there any reality beyond death? You have to face the deepest levels of metaphysical angst until your identity is crushed and shattered. That’s easier for some than others, but you must surrender your time-space identity to gain access to the next level. At that next level, I continued a deepening confrontation with pain, suffering, and violence—so deep and prolonged, encompassing so many hundreds of thousands of persons over thousands of years, that I concluded it wasn’t a cleansing of my personal psyche. Something was using my sessions to set in motion a reconciliation and healing of levels of pain that were fundamentally collective. Then further deaths and rebirths followed, where the nature of death and suffering changes the deeper you go. The basic principle is simple: if you want to experience oneness with God or the mind of the universe, our historical consciousness is too small—if you want to literally experience it, not just think it. To immerse yourself in communion with these levels, your small identity must be surrendered and you must flow into a larger identity. Eventually you enter levels where it would misrepresent things to say “Chris Bache went and had those experiences.” Rather, Chris Bache has to be destroyed, dissolved, for these levels of consciousness to manifest inside my awareness. The fact that I remember them doesn’t mean my personality was present when they were had. You lose yourself, enter communion with the universe, and when you come back you gather the experiences, and my personality synthesizes and integrates them. It’s a pulsing: surrender completely, open, breathe, receive teachings, then bring it back in and consolidate.",

The question of suffering is profound; we could spend the whole program on it. If the creative intelligence is intelligent and loving, how could it have tolerated—let alone manifested—a world so painful, where terrible things happen at an organic and social level? To even attempt to comprehend suffering, we need a very long time horizon, a deep look into the workings of the universe—a galactic perspective.\n\nThe human species is radically unfinished, very incomplete. How young are we? On a 1-to-100 scale, are we 95% finished or 5%? I think we’re more like 5–10%. We just woke up—4,000 or 5,000 years ago—to the underlying level of consciousness recognized in the true religious traditions. This universe has been building this world for 3.7 billion years; we’re just waking up and learning to engage consciously rather than unconsciously.",

That transition was marked by an experience I call “the killing of the children.” I was an old woman confronting soldiers who were killing thousands of children, smashing their heads on rocks—terrible. I think that experience prepared me for the ocean of suffering phase. It awakened a depth of compassion, embedded at a soul level, to take on the work my soul had chosen in this lifetime. I learned that just as individual trauma gets buried in our psyche and compromises our health, the trauma of history is buried in the collective psyche of humanity. Anything not resolved by the species accumulates in massive memory structures I call metacoic systems. Something guiding my sessions began to use them to confront, absorb, and transmute vast territories of collective anguish embedded in the collective psyche—meaning the patient stopped being Chris Bache and, in some way, became an aspect of the human species.",

I want to be careful not to overemphasize the negative, though, because there’s a rhythm: purification, then ecstasy. The only thing that makes the purification bearable are the ecstatic blessings that follow. After processing the ocean of suffering, I’d also be integrating the gift of earlier unitive experiences—being taken on the “cosmic tour,” visiting the beginning of creation, and so on. This rhythm—of purification and blessing—kept pace throughout. The deeper the purification, the deeper the blessings. Once you learn that rhythm, you’re no longer afraid of purification; you seek it out. Not because you crave pain, but because you long for what lies beyond it.",

People don’t need to be afraid that what I went through is a necessary part of any spiritual journey or cosmological exploration. I think my soul chose to do this before I was born.

How can we assert that there is intelligence, let alone compassion, in such a universe? To see the wisdom and the intelligence, we have to look very deep and very wide. On the surface, life can be a mean son of a bitch—cruel and vindictive—decimated by circumstances that crush the human heart.\n\nFrom a reincarnation perspective, our life did not begin with birth, and it does not end at death; our life is part of a larger story.

But just to pick up where you started—the sense of suffering you described—stepping back, what do you understand to be the significance of suffering in the evolutionary process? Why is suffering part of evolution?\n\nChris Bache:\nThat really is a core question, isn’t it? It’s deep, and hard to answer without preparing the ground, so I’ll take shortcuts and ask your listeners’ indulgence. During the same period of the cosmic tour—when I was being given a crash course in Cosmology 101—I was taken back to what appeared to be the beginning of creation itself, the beginning of time and space, and I experienced an overwhelming love saturating me. It was a cosmic love. Then I witnessed the birth of space and time and all of evolution taking place inside this love, held and guided by it.",

It was part of my karmic choice, not forced on me and not a tragedy—simply part of my life’s work. The universe more than rewarded me for this phase. Following the ocean of suffering—indeed within it and afterwards—it took me places and more than repaid me for taking it on.

With reincarnation, you have to live with it for a long time and bring the questions people are asking into that paradigm, then sit with it to get intimations of the depth of how it recontextualizes the way we usually think. Here’s a question by Jacqueline that really stretches us: how can collective suffering be a creative process rooted in cosmic love? That’s a hard question, because of the sheer scale. It’s hard even for an individual life: how is suffering in our life compatible with the idea that the universe is compassionate and loving? At a collective level—of the type we were talking about in our third dialog, our coming challenging period of history—how can suffering of that magnitude be a creative process rooted in cosmic love?",

In my chapter “The Ocean of Suffering,” after ego death and going deeper, I was drawn into vast fields of human suffering—terrible anger, torture, pain. It continued for two years. At first I thought it was refining my ego death, but eventually I realized it wasn’t aimed at my personal transformation. It was aimed at transforming my entire human family. In these sessions, consciousness had expanded far beyond “Chris Bache.” It was as if I were the species, remembering and reliving the species’ pain. By letting humanity’s suffering enter full awareness, a transformation takes place that registers in the individual, but also—this is my hypothesis—registers in the species as a whole. Just as individuals carry scars from trauma, the species carries scars from all the terrible things we’ve done to each other, held in the collective psyche.",

In Buddhist practice, the first thing you do when you begin any meditation is cultivate bodhicitta, the aspiration to save all sentient beings. You do the practice not for yourself.

How can we assert intelligence, let alone compassion, in such a universe? To see the wisdom and intelligence, we have to look very deep and very wide. On the surface, life can be cruel—decimated by circumstances that crush the human heart. From a reincarnation perspective, our life did not begin at birth and does not end at death; it’s part of a larger story. Why someone would choose a life with so much suffering may be impossible to answer from within time-space and an individual perspective. To glimpse larger patterns, we have to open to a very large evolutionary and spiritual perspective.\n\nMost important, I think, is understanding that all our suffering is preserved, conserved, and used. All human suffering is experienced by the Divine. There is no Divine outside human suffering watching us. Everything humanity suffers—everything the animal kingdom suffers—the spiritual world suffers at a very deep level.",

In a therapeutic modality with psychedelics, your system becomes hyperconscious for a time. When that happens, it spontaneously begins to cleanse itself. It brings forward the parts of your past you’ve struggled with—pain, fear, unfinished business. By confronting those fears and pains heroically, you can bring to resolution things that started in the past but never completed—ugly deaths, problematic relationships, and so on. Embracing the suffering that presents itself—letting it into awareness—allows it to move to a better outcome. The system relaxes, and you’re free to move into deeper levels of reality.\n\nEarly on, as consciousness expands beyond time-space, you may face ego death—the shattering of the identity formed in time-space. It’s painful, an inversion of everything you’ve known yourself to be, but in surrender, consciousness is liberated into deeper textures of mind. If you continue, you cycle through further purifications and deeper deaths, each followed by entry into deeper dimensions of reality, always working a particular edge.",
