When we open ourselves in deep psychedelic states, it’s as if our mind is a seed-catalyst dropped into this ocean, and it crystallizes a set of experiences out of this infinite potential. By absorbing and internalizing what we’re being offered—what we’re being taught—we’re changed, purified, transformed inwardly. Then, when we drop that changed mind back into the infinite potential, it triggers an even deeper set of experiences from its infinity.\n\nI experienced myself as engaging an intelligence—a consciousness—that was directing my sessions. I did not control what was unfolding. I was always yielding and following a lead that came from deeper levels of consciousness. As the journey continued, the levels of consciousness I was entering deepened multiple times.",

It raises substantial intellectual questions: how do you possibly integrate experiences that so radically transcend the conditions of time and space and our consciousness inside time and space? If you have temporary experiences that go radically beyond spatial consciousness and linear time, what does it even mean to integrate them? What does integration look like when you’re dealing with such radical experiences? With lower-dose work or gentler psychedelics, where experiences come closer to your world inside time and space, integration is less demanding. But if you really open the very deep waters of the psyche, integration becomes a more substantive issue.\n\nEmmy Vadnais:\nWe’re getting lots of questions. This one from Robert Bushman might be a good place to start: What is consciousness? Is there an ultimate reality, or is it infinitely fractal? How can an individual’s conscious awareness expand without psychedelics? How can one remember past lives? Maybe starting with: what is consciousness?",

Creation is intentional. I hesitate to use “design,” but there is an intelligence manifesting in time and space. We are part of this intelligence; our nature is of the same nature as its nature—Atman is Brahman. Reincarnation is a fact of life. We won’t get far trying to understand existence unless we understand the pulse of life—that our current life is just the most recent in many cycles of life and death. There is an underlying logic to our circumstances—what Buddhists and Hindus call karma—an intentionality working itself out in our lives. Our evolution is not driven solely by blind chance and mechanical processes; there is a deeper intelligence manifesting in our circumstances and challenges, inviting us to become more by the end of life than we were at the beginning. Those are a few touch points.",

In the end, once we make this transition, we understand that what we have escaped is not time and space, but a constricted consciousness associated with living inside time and space. When that bubble pops—when we truly escape that small world—we experience time and space completely differently: as the Buddha world, as Buddha nature.\n\nTasshin Fogleman:\nIf you don’t mind me asking, what is your everyday consciousness like now after all of these experiences and explorations?",

Could you speak to that?\nChris Bache:\nI always felt myself engaging—and being engaged by—a larger consciousness. It didn’t take concrete, personified form. Its core qualities changed as I went deeper. The way I think of it: the consciousness we enter into in psychedelic states is an infinite consciousness capable of generating any number of experiences. Our mind acts as a seed crystal that catalyzes certain experiences from this infinite field.\n\nIf you do this repeatedly, as you integrate experiences and undergo purifications, your consciousness changes. The consciousness you take into the next encounter catalyzes a deeper set of experiences from the infinite potential. What you experience as a guiding intelligence arises at the intersection of your individual mind and the universal mind; as you change, that intersection changes. The guiding consciousness felt constant to me but remained formless, seldom adopting concrete form—because forms would change as the experiences deepened.",

To enter higher levels, you reverse the process: you decouple, let go at deeper levels, so that you literally become, for hours at a time, a citizen of that level of reality. You stop being Chris Bache. You stop being a human being. You stop being a time-space being at all. You literally live and breathe the nature of that existence. There is always a profound sense of homecoming and return. All existence comes from this reality, so there’s a tremendous sense of stillness, calm, reunion—being restored to your primal wholeness.

Why do you believe that is the case?\nChris Bache:\nPart of my experience reflects a classic teaching in some Eastern traditions: the essence of the individual is the same as the essence of the totality—Atman is Brahman. Our nature is the nature of the divine, which is the nature of reality itself. So it’s not completely accurate to frame this as a duality between me and It. At a deeper level, my being is a fractal manifestation of Its reality. Our relationship is deeply essential and mutually participating from the start. But functionally, in terms of Chris Bache, I am so small and It is so vast that there’s a relative duality involved. And between my small bit and the totality are layers upon layers. It’s a very complex, organic system of massive scale.",

I eventually differentiated five levels of consciousness that seemed operational. The first takes place at the level of personal mind, where you go beyond your personal time-space identity, culminating in what we classically call ego death—your consciousness exploding beyond the parameters of your physical experience. The second takes place at the collective level of mind—species mind—lots of experiences in the collective unconscious. The third goes deeper into the archetypal mind, beyond the species mind into archetypal reality. The fourth is the One Mind—causal reality—where the fundamental theme is oneness. There are many degrees and permutations of oneness, but that’s the core domain. In the last five years of my work, I entered what I came to call the Diamond Luminosity— the clear light of absolute reality, as it's called in Buddhism, Dharmakaya.",

      "text": "n individually while others aren’t. How can that be, that an individual awakes yet another does not?\nChris Bache:\nThe metaphor I like to use when teaching my students is that of leaves and the tree. Imagine leaves being individually conscious, yet they are manifestations of the consciousness of the tree. So we are individually conscious, and there is a narrative of individual evolution, but if you really dig deep and ask “what is an individual?” then you encounter the collective psyche—the consciousness of the planet, the galaxy, and then deeper, as you say, the absolute, what I call my belovedness. Individual awakening is a mistaken inference. It’s true that if you don’t work individually, you make no progress, but when you do, you're actually drawing many people's consciousness into your work. So it’s impossible to put a boundary on awakening; the universe doesn't even think in terms of individuals—it's interested in awakening the entire species. Not this religion, that continent, but the whole human family into evolutionary progression. I began to realize I wasn’t doing these sessions for personal work or healing, or even personal transformation.",

Did you have an experience of what else?\nChris Bache\nFirst of all, I think soul consciousness is what we return to when we die. While we are in the Bardo Earth kind of stage after death, we return to whole consciousness. It’s not unfamiliar; it’s something we know. Then we precipitate out of whole consciousness into part consciousness—egoic consciousness—and return. It’s a constant accordion effect: we die and get large; we’re born and get small; we die and get large; we’re born and get small. Sooner or later—if we just keep up for a few thousand years, a hundred million years—large wakes up inside physical consciousness. It’s simply a consolidation of what takes place naturally and normally, a stage in the process.",

We know about emergence; things happen in jumps, we hit tipping points. We think we’re coming to an evolutionary tipping point. When people have near-death experiences, they go through exponential increases in awareness in a very short time. More than one author has suggested that the human race is coming to a collective near-death experience—a potential jumping point. If fields can tip in small groups—if we hit that at large scale, in darkness or early dawn—I’d say we have a long way to go and little time to get there. The only way we could possibly make that kind of evolutionary progress is by understanding field dynamics, because then we’re not trying to change seven billion minds—we only need to change one mind, and the seven billion experiences are being processed at an integral level. If we understand nonlinear systems, and hypothesize the human collective unconscious as such a system, then when it’s thrown into far-from-equilibrium conditions, things can happen fast; there can be jumps. I really think that some dynamic like that underlies humanity’s potential for quantum change. It’s not simply an aggregate of individuals—there’s a deeper summation coming from all those individuals.",

We’re just scratching the surface. If we’re working therapeutically and bringing out issues from the personal unconscious, we have a model for integration.
